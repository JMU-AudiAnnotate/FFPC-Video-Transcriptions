<h1 style="text-align:center">African American Poetry and the Vernacular Matrix Part 3</h1>
<p>This panel, from the first historic Furious Flower conference in 1994, features three renowned poets as panelists, and a moderator. A number of the audience members in attendance would go on to become influential educators, critics, and poets themselves – if they had not already gained this well-deserved recognition. For a diverse group of poets and critics, this marked a formative moment that influenced the direction of individual careers, and shaped the discourse around the concept of vernacular language and art generally.In his opening remarks for the roundtable, Alvin Aubert notes that: "African American poetry, perhaps more than fiction and drama, has leant and continues to lend itself to the thematic and formalistic expression of its matrixing in African American culture, in the vernacular (folk and popular) culture in particular."<a href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>This recording begins as the last panelist, Sherley Anne Williams, presents her work, and continues with a question and discussion section. Among the topics covered in the panel are the inclusion of music in poetry performance, the place of the secular and the spiritual in poetry, the relation between folk and popular art forms, and the directions Black poetry might take in the future.</p>
