  <h1>Brenda Marie Osbey</h1>
 <p>Brenda Marie Osbey is a poet, essayist, theorist, and historian who has published several books of poems, including <i>All Souls: Essential Poems</i>, <i>History and Other Poems</i>, and <i>Desperate Circumstance, Dangerous Woman</i>. Her work has been published in numerous journals, including <i>Callaloo</i>, <i>Southern Review</i>, and <i>2PLUS2</i>. Alongside many critics, she has emphasized the deep relationship her work and thought have to history, especially as it is manifested in New Orleans. As Thadious Davis notes in her book <i>Southscapes– Geographies of Race, Region, and Literature</i>, “\[Osbey’s\] selective knowledge of a past is part of the cultural logic of her New Orleans as an architectonic space. Historical memory for her is a way to get at the structures of the past.”<sup>[1]</sup></p>
 <br>
<p>She focuses on historical reclamation through her characters’ forces of imagination. Osbey disrupts conventional poetic forms in order to break with the false mythologies of white history.  According to the critic Laura Vrana, the themes of Osbey’s poems, as well as the sometimes experimental forms which she uses in storytelling, draw from the forms of the <i>griot</i> oral tradition. Working with the past as a presence embedded in historical location, she also explores the way the dead can speak to the living, and the enduring links between their realms. Osbey has been influenced by Robert Hayden, Gayl Jones, and Sherley Anne Williams, among others.</p>

  <p>In this interview with Carmen Gillespie, Osbey discusses the omnipresence of history, the process of reclaiming images through her poetry, the profound ways in which Black Americans have transformed and redefined colonial languages through artistic tradition, expression, and resistance, as well as the beauty and complexity of New Orleanian culture.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
