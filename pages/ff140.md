<p>Velma Pollard is a Jamaican poet and educator. She attended the University College of the West Indies for her undergraduate studies, where she studied alongside many now renowned poets. Until her recent retirement, Pollard served as a professor of UWI at Mona, and served as the Dean of the Faculty of Education. She has published multiple poetry collections, including <i>Shame Trees Don’t Grow Here</i> and <i>Leaving Traces</i>. She has also published multiple short story collections, and a novella, <i>Karl and Other Stories</i>, which won the <i>Casa de las Americas</i> award in 1992.</p>
<p>In her collection, <i>Shame Trees Don’t Grow Here</i>, Pollard emphasizes the importance of cultivating moral consciousness, and the consequences of neglecting it. Her poems cover the destructive forces of colonialism and capitalism on indigenous populations, her experiences in the U.S. and England, and descriptions of Caribbean landscapes. She continues these themes in <i>The Best Philosophers I Know Can’t Read or Write</i>, infusing her personal poems with Caribbean history, and reimagining pre-colonial indigenous cultures. She also reimagines the traditional wisdom of African folktales and proverbs.</p>
<p>In addition to her works of literature, she has published essays in journals such as <i>Callaloo</i> and <i>Carribean Quarterly</i>, and a linguistic study on Dread Talk and its relation to Rastafarianism.</p>

She taught at Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Richmond for decades. She has published several works, including <i>Shuckin’ and Jivin’</i> and <i>Long Gone</i>. In 2013, she was named the Sterling A. Brown Professor of English at Howard University. In 2011, the Daryl Cumber Dance Lifetime Achievement Award was established in her honor through the CLA.</p>
