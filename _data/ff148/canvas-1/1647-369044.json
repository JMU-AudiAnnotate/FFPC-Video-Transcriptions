The audience listening to the poem, seeing the poem, hearing the poem being performed, understands the poem, grasps the poem, responds to the poem in the moment. And that's a wonderful thing to be a part of. One of the best things about poetry is the live poetry reading. Because there's a kind of energy that takes place, there's something that passes between the poet and the audience, when it's working.</font>",
