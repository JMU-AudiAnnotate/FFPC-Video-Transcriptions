Because as a writer, when you see so many different voices in front of you that are acknowledged and recognized, it empowers others in the sense that we don't have to write in any one particular style, but we could truly write from our own voices because all the voices are there. And we don't have to imitate. So it's a wonderful example, to model for a conference to have out there. There's nothing else I think that touches it. </font>",
