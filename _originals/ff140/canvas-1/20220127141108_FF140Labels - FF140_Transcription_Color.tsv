24.285232	32.787975	<font color="#008080">Velma, tell me what it means to you as a poet, and as a West Indian poet, to be a part of this Furious Flower conference.</font>	Transcription, Question
33.661545	64.760619	<font color="navy">I am overwhelmed. I am flattered. I feel very special. I don't know why me. Chance is something else. If Joanne Gabbin had never met me, she would never have heard my name. If she didn't know you, she would never have met me. Because it's through you that she met me. If you had never come to Jamaica, you would never have met me. So it's chance, all the time.</font>	Transcription
64.236477	65.983616	<font color="#008080">Everything, I suppose.</font>	Transcription
65.750664	67.090137	<font color="navy">And I'm grateful.</font>	Transcription
67.090137	74.719311	<font color="#008080">Have you personally been affected by African American poets and poetry, in your own development as a poet? </font>	Transcription, Question
75.476404	99.528684	<font color="navy">I don't know that I can say my own development as a poet, but certainly as a person. And it's hard for me to think what has affected me as a poet. But it's much easier for me to understand what has affected me as a person. I came upon African American poetry, and literature generally, seriously in 1968.</font>	Transcription
99.528684	123.231537	<font color="navy">When I got a little work, in Harlem, in a storefront homework center, where I was supervising homework for children who didn't have parents who could do homework with them. I hired some undergraduates from Hunter College. And every afternoon, we supervised homework.</font>	Transcription
123.231537	143.556587	<font color="navy">This was my first time living in America. And I thought I need to know about this culture. I don't know. I knew hardly anything about it, except for the big names that everybody had read. And so I started to read. And I read and read and read, and a whole other world was opened up to me.</font>	Transcription
143.556587	150.021001	<font color="#008080">Wonderful. Could you tell me about other influences, early influences, family, place, home, school.</font>	Transcription, Question
149.20567	178.208177	<font color="navy">I think well, home, school, I think school. I think that I was impressed early in terms of poetry by some of the, I suppose some of the big names. I have to say that John Donne, although he was a religious man, to some extent, and an English man, and all the rest of it. But I think that very early in life I identified Donne as somebody who I related to.</font>	Transcription
178.208177	193.932428	<font color="navy">His passion, he was a man who was as passionate about a woman as he was about Christ. I mean, some of that poetry moved me as early in high school as I could remember. So that's where I remember first.</font>	Transcription
193.932428	214.49043	<font color="#008080">You know, when I was at UWI, University of the West Indies in 1978, I always felt such a sense of awe to be in the presence of so many literary people. And I'd just like to know what it meant to you to go to school there, to work there from all those years from the 1950s onward,</font>	Transcription
214.49043	247.045453	<font color="#008080">and to associate with notables at one time or another, such as Derek Walcott, Orlando Patterson, Jean D'Costa, Garth St. Omer, Sylvia Wynter, John Hearne, Slade Hopkinson, Mervyn Morris, Kamau Brathwaite, Olive Senior, Pamela Mordecai, Lorna Goodison, Vic Reid, Louise Bennett, Ken Ramchand, Rex Nettleford, Eddie Baugh, Dennis Scott, Tony McNeill, Lorna Goodison, and of course your sister Erna Brodber. What's it like to interact with-- </font>	Transcription
246.812501	255.839386	<font color="navy">The thing is that I am lucky that as you were calling those names, I was thinking-- I have never, I don't think of any of them as literary people, or artists.</font>	Transcription
254.558151	258.227143	<font color="#008080">But you can't think of West Indian literature without thinking of--</font>	Transcription
257.237097	285.133083	<font color="navy">But I don't think of West Indian literature. Those people are all people that I have known. I mean, I went to university with Eddie Baugh, Mervyn Morris, Garth St. Omer, the lot of them. The things I remember about them are unspeakable. They wouldn't want to remember the things that I remember about them. You know? I remember Garth St. Omer jumping over a fence to prevent me from doing something I would have been unhappy to have done. To go and spy on somebody. And he just stopped me and said you are not going.</font>	Transcription
285.133083	305.458133	<font color="navy">I don't remember that he has written novels, I remember that. You know, or I remember walking home from the union with Slade Hopkinson and those guys and just-- people mocking each other's accents because we're all from different islands. Things like that that are not at all literary. So because I knew all these people before they became important, it--</font>	Transcription
305.458133	310.583074	<font color="#008080">Well in later years tell me about interactions. I know you've collaborated, </font>	Transcription, Question
310.583074	336.790159	<font color="navy">Yeah, well the interaction at this-- now when I came back onto the campus, and all my little friends were now important people, this was awe. I remember going to an eight o'clock class to hear Mervyn Morris lecture and losing my one gold earring. And I said now, why was I even at that lecture at eight in the morning, who invited me? But I didn't know Mervyn as a lecturer or anything.</font>	Transcription
336.790159	366.84095	<font color="navy">Or going to hear Eddie Baugh. Talk about Brathwaite's-- there's this poem called <i>Rights [of Passage]</i>. Eddie Baugh gave a phenomenal lecture on <i>Rights</i>. And he read from that poem. You know, Eddie Baugh's voice is the best thing in the Caribbean. Reading Kamau Brathwaite. That was like 19-- I came back in 1975. So that may have been '75 or '76. And I recognized that the little people that I had known, had grown. They had become mountains.</font>	Transcription
366.84095	367.889233	<font color="#008080">Do you remember where you--?</font>	Transcription
367.481567	368.413375	<font color="navy">I said-- hmm?</font>	Transcription
368.413375	374.936027	<font color="#008080">I'm sorry, do you remember where you were when you found out that Derek was a Nobel Laureate?</font>	Transcription, Question
374.936027	400.32778	<font color="navy">I must have heard about it before I saw it on the-- I can't remember where I heard. I know that I was at the TV to watch him receive the prize. And I really was overwhelmed. Well, the first thing I did when I heard that he got it, I phoned a young American scholar who I know who had told me that he would never get it because of <i>The Boston Sun</i>. </font>	Transcription
398.580641	399.628925	<font color="#008080">Oh yes.</font>	Transcription
400.32778	433.406945	<font color="navy">And I said, people know that it's not his private life that they're giving him the prize for. In any case, most West Indians don't believe that story <i>in that way</i>. Because people in the Caribbean are accustomed to saying things to people that they don't really mean all the time. I read Walcott's poetry, and I see some of it and I read the way that people analyze it, and the high sounding words they say about it.</font>	Transcription
433.406945	436.202368	<font color="navy">And I say-- I'll give you one quick example.</font>	Transcription
436.202368	437.949507	<font color="#008080">Yes, please.</font>	Transcription
437.949507	464.680733	<font color="navy">This is one of my favorite Walcott poems. It is, I think it's called <i>The Light of the World</i>. A lot of people have written a lot about it, it's supposed to be a poem from which another life came or something. All kinds of things have been said about it. But the lines where he says, 'O beauty, you are the light of the world!' Oh, they have gone to Italy, they have gone to everywhere, to assess it.</font>	Transcription
464.680733	489.257155	<font color="navy">And I know that Caribbean men say things like this to women all the time. Oh, lady, Moses must have been sleeping when one like you left heaven. Who knows if Moses was even in heaven? But that kind of thing is said, so 'O beauty, you are the light of the world!'. And I say, you know, they've said everything about it but they have not said this is a man as they would say in Ghana souring a woman.</font>	Transcription
489.257155	502.768363	<font color="#008080">Yes, yes. You know, Velma, when you told me about that, it reminded me of what I know once about you're giving a book to a publisher, and his offering to have somebody check the Creole for you.</font>	Transcription
501.894794	502.768363	<font color="navy">Yes!</font>	Transcription
502.768363	513.425911	<font color="#008080">Talk a little bit about responses from so called, 'First World' publishers and critics and so forth to either your own word or other--</font>	Transcription, Question
513.425911	535.090434	<font color="navy">Well, in this case, the person they were asking to check my Creole-- unfortunately, I had heard her give a lecture, and her English was not so hot. So I wrote back and I told them that what I did for a living was teach people about Creole. Had they known that they may not have suggested this.</font>	Transcription
535.090434	566.131271	<font color="navy">And I said, if you don't want to publish the book, that's fine. But I'm not going to change anything. And since I had tested it and found somebody who does not speak the Creole who was a Canadian visitor who didn't have a problem with it. I can write an explanation about the use of the Creole. And so I wrote the afterword, and that satisfied them. Generally speaking, I think it has been a bit of a battle that was won before I started writing seriously, was half won.</font>	Transcription
566.131271	596.356775	<font color="navy">The other thing, and here I'm quoting Olive Senior to a certain extent, she was saying once-- and I don't doubt that she remembers saying it-- that she's glad that she was already a professional in her own right before she became well known as a writer. And I think I can't use the well known for myself, but I can say that I am also glad that I had sort of made my name professionally before, so that I could stand up and say, if you don't want to publish my book, well, that's fine, but this is the situation.</font>	Transcription
596.356775	603.927711	<font color="#008080">And to some degree, I guess the generation of Vic Reid and Sam Selvon and those people, yeah, paved the way. Exactly.</font>	Transcription
599.851053	604.80128	<font color="navy">They paved the way for us. This is why I say we benefited from what they did. Yes.</font>	Transcription
604.80128	614.410545	<font color="#008080">Velma, let's talk a little bit about your creative process. I remember once you told me you started out writing everything down on a yellow pad. Is that still the way you work?</font>	Transcription, Question
614.410545	643.47129	<font color="navy">I thought this morning as I was sitting in front of you writing in my yellow pad, that maybe you know that a poem is coming, yes. I do not travel without the yellow pad. Sometimes it's not yellow, sometimes it's white because sometimes I can't find a yellow pad, but it's mostly yellow-- and a pencil. I don't know why but I really-- I think that what I get from that is the immediacy. When I get a thought like what I was writing this morning, it is immediate.</font>	Transcription
643.47129	665.659955	<font color="navy">So when I go back to it, I'm responding to something that was, what Houston Baker just called the... impulse? I like that term. If you wait to write at the computer, or at your desk, you are going to lose that. First thing, I don't have the kind of memory that would ever take things with me into when I get comfortable.</font>	Transcription
665.659955	693.148275	<font color="navy">So when it was not the yellow pad, it was a note paper at the kitchen table when I had less time for myself. And I was always busy. And even now if I go to sleep, I always have a pencil and a page. I fold the computer sheet the used sheets over. And I always have that and a pencil on my bed. I may write something to buy in the supermarket tomorrow, or I may write a line.</font>	Transcription
693.148275	697.283171	<font color="#008080">But when you say, when you had less time for yourself are you speaking of when you had a family?</font>	Transcription, Question
697.283171	703.339919	<font color="navy">Bringing up children working on, you know, doing more things than I should have to do. Yes, that's--</font>	Transcription
703.339919	713.473325	<font color="#008080">Would you share with us one of your favorite poems and tell us a little something about its history and its composition?</font>	Transcription, Question
712.075614	741.718739	<font color="navy">Well, I'm not sure that this is my favorite poem, but I think it's other people's, because it is my most anthologized poem. And it did come out in the first six or so poems that I had published. So it's an old poem. Pam Mordecai put together, Pam Mordecai and Mervyn Morris put together <i>Jamaica Woman</i> in 1980 before any of the women in here had their own collections out yet, and this was included. It's called <i>Fly</i>.</font>	Transcription

846.19765	850.099594	<font color="#008080">Is that an autobiographical poem?</font>	Transcription, Question
849.808404	873.860684	<font color="navy">The thing is, it might be, but I really do not know. Because I think I may have started out by thinking 'ef a ketch im/ a mash im/ ef a ketch im/ a mash im', which is the way the train goes up the hill in Jamaica, 'ef a ketch im/ a mash im/ ef a ketch im/ a mash im'. And our trains have to-- used to, we have no trains now-- used to go up very steep hills.</font>	Transcription
873.860684	895.932874	<font color="navy">I think it started with a notion that when we were saying it in elementary school, we were not really listening to the words, that it is a cruel refrain. In other words, if anybody's on the train line, when the train is coming, the person is going to die. So, 'ef a ketch im/ a mash im'. I think that's where it started that kind of realization.</font>	Transcription
895.932874	899.543628	<font color="#008080">But no thought of the woman entrapped by the rails.</font>	Transcription
899.1942	901.174291	<font color="navy">And then, I was about to say,</font>	Transcription
900.766625	901.523718	<font color="#008080">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>	Transcription
901.523718	930.40975	<font color="navy">it moves to the woman entrapped. And not just me, but all other women, I mean, running for that trap rushing to get to the point where you want to go to the cinema but you have to go home to cook. Women rush to get to it. And then they realize. Too late, I suppose. It is a very cynical poem but I didn't think it was cynical when I was writing it. But the more I read it, the more it sounds cynical.</font>	Transcription
930.40975	935.127025	<font color="#008080">Is it simply that you've moved on to another period so that you aren't quite the feminist?</font>	Transcription, Question
934.428169	935.359977	<font color="navy">As trapped?</font>	Transcription
935.359977	939.611348	<font color="#008080">Well, quite the feminist that I think I hear there.</font>	Transcription
939.611348	954.46203	<font color="navy">Well, and people accuse me of that. But I don't know if feminist is just realist. Perhaps reality is what they call feminism, you know, just describing the truth.</font>	Transcription
955.102647	958.655163	<font color="#008080">Okay. And talk a little bit about Anansi, and using that--</font>	Transcription, Question
958.655163	990.686045	<font color="navy">Anansi. Well, you know, Anansi is the patron saint of insects in a sense. Anansi, and I've used Anansi a lot. I have a collection called <i>Ananses??m</i> which is a word for Anansi stories, a word from Twi in Ghana. Anansi came to us from Twi, from the Akan tradition, he is both a spider and a god. For some reason, in Jamaica, he took on a trickster personality.</font>	Transcription
990.686045	1021.319215	<font color="navy">But, and a trickster personality that I consider to have been much maligned. Anansi gets the better of people, but gets the better of people by finding their Achilles heel. I mean, snake was so proud of his length and power and what have you. Anansi humbled him by just discovering, you know, what really was at the heart of his notions about himself, and using it.</font>	Transcription
1021.319215	1040.595982	<font color="navy">So we have all this blame for Anansi. Anansi tricks people and all the rest of it, but Anansi only tricks people who can be tricked. Anansi, I cry. I'm warning them, Look, don't come into this net. But only if you can listen, will you hear. So that's, that's Anansi.</font>	Transcription
1040.595982	1061.328698	<font color="navy">They always talk about Caribbean people, and the Anansi-ism. I'm sure you've heard of it up here, where we come and in no time we have a house and whatever. And it's all because of our tricks. But I think Anansi is about taking opportunity when it offers itself, and just looking around and making sure that you see it. </font>	Transcription
1061.328698	1062.726409	<font color="#008080">And much industry.</font>	Transcription
1062.726409	1088.292876	<font color="navy">And much industry. Anansi, I think, is part of a migrant personality, it need not be a West Indian coming to America or going to England, it could be any migrant going anywhere. And that same person at home is quite laid back. People from here come to the Caribbean just to comment on how laid back we are. And then they meet us up here and say how industrious we are. It's the same people. Different situation.</font>	Transcription
1087.419307	1092.48601	<font color="#008080">And you know, our Brer Rabbit is brother to Anansi.</font>	Transcription
1089.748826	1092.48601	<font color="navy">Yeah, right. Yes, I know.</font>	Transcription
1092.48601	1098.076855	<font color="#008080">The very same tales as a matter of fact, of African origin obviously, are told here with Brer Rabbit.</font>	Transcription
1098.076855	1101.338181	<font color="navy">Maybe a different folk tradition within Africa.</font>	Transcription
1101.338181	1120.498472	<font color="#008080">Exactly. Exactly. Velma, your latest collection of poetry seems so much more reflective about the concerns of aging, and even dying. And I suppose that is a kind of natural progression as we age and experience the deaths of our parents and friends and what have you.</font>	Transcription
1120.498472	1141.17295	<font color="#008080">But one in particular, I want to ask you about though you may say something generally about the subject matter and your interest in the kind of subject matter that we see in your poems more recently. But one poem, <i>We Are Our Grandmother's</i> concludes, 'I know that I am grand'. Talk a little bit about what you're saying there. </font>	Transcription, Question
1138.668717	1163.652805	<font color="navy">Gran. Well, that is really harking back to the short story that is not so short about <i>Gran</i>, which is about, which is perhaps my only autobiographical piece about my grandmother. And this is a woman who really, I have always had a great respect for. When her husband died she had seven children: one was nine, the oldest, and the youngest was nine months.</font>	Transcription
1163.652805	1192.13117	<font color="navy">And she-- now, she was not poverty-stricken, I have to admit. There was land, there was a mill and copper, which is what they used to make sugar. But all of that stuff her husband was in charge of and he just died quite suddenly. And I remember her at the mill and copper, giving orders to men so much taller and bigger than she was. And just getting out there at six o'clock every morning and doing what had to be done and,</font>	Transcription
1192.13117	1230.451752	<font color="navy">She's established herself as a baker so she was baking, she was selling sugar where people would come to the boiling house to but by the sugar in these pans, sort of, and making sure there was enough money to put all the children through school. So whenever I see myself doing something and people say, how do you manage that? I know that I'm not doing much, I'm doing a quarter of what she did. But in a sense I am Gran. And I'm not sure which bit of Alice Walker's work I had read. Why I dedicated it to her. Oh, she said, 'We are all grandmothers'. Yes, yes, that's it. That's how that came--</font>	Transcription
1230.451752	1241.808156	<font color="#008080">You once said that Gran is an excuse to 'big up' a strong female symbol of Jamaican peasantocracy. How important do you see that still, in Jamaican society?</font>	Transcription, Question
1241.808156	1273.664323	<font color="navy">I see its lack, still. And I think that a lot of the people who have gone astray now have not had access to this kind of person, nor respect for this kind of person. Everybody wants to get rich very quickly. My grandmother had to do lots of things so that my mother could have a profession, so that she could want me to have a profession. Everybody wants to be well off, or to get where I am, and that's not being that well off, but comfortable. Everybody wants to get comfortable in one generation.</font>	Transcription
1273.664323	1298.415459	<font color="navy">People long ago sacrificed, knowing that the next generation would benefit. Nobody is willing to sacrifice now. That's why we have in Jamaica, young women leaving their babies at home to go to dances. Do you know how many children die by fire in my country, because their mothers went to a dance? Went to a dance, and left the children there.</font>	Transcription
1298.415459	1313.790282	<font color="navy">So it's a kind of-- I think that we need to get back to saying, not that we want them to be downtrodden or anything, but we just want people to take responsibility and to know that there were people who take responsibility.</font>	Transcription
1313.790282	1350.654915	<font color="navy">And the word 'peasantocracy', I like it. Because an academic, a social scientist on the campus, spoke tongue in cheek of my sister and I said, ha, they're not poor people my dear, those are from the peasantocray. And what he meant is that we grew up in the country and people think, 'where did they even learn to read books?' But there were books, and there was knife and fork and doilies and all these little things that you expect in homes of people who have money. So that -ocracy, peasantocracy, he labels for people like us who behave as if we...</font>	Transcription
1350.189011	1351.761436	<font color="#008080">Came from the aristocracy?</font>	Transcription
1351.761436	1357.701709	<font color="navy">But we don't really. They are from right down there, the peasanto--. So it is a put down, but a nice put down.</font>	Transcription
1357.701709	1367.485687	<font color="#008080">Well, speaking of your sister, we certainly have to get to that famous writer as well. And I'd love for you to share my favorite story, about...</font>	Transcription, Question
1367.485687	1370.339347	<font color="navy">Oh, you mean how <i>Jane and Louisa</i> came to be published.</font>	Transcription
1370.339347	1376.862	<font color="#008080">Exactly, <i>Jane and Louisa</i>, of course, is one of the classics of modern Carribean literature, yes.</font>	Transcription
1373.484197	1378.434425	<font color="navy">Of Carribean literature. Well, my sister is a social scientist.</font>	Transcription
1378.434425	1381.113371	Can I interrupt? Could you say your sister's full name? [Inaudible] want to hear it.	Transcription
1381.113371	1397.18705	<font color="navy">I'll say it. Yes. Well Erna Brodber is my sister. B-r-o-d-b-e-r is my maiden name and her name. She's a social-- a historian, a social scientist, and what have you.</font>	Transcription
1397.18705	1420.715188	<font color="navy">And she had been well known in that she's written things like abandonment of children, yards in the City of Kingston. And that's how she made her name. And then she came up with this volume, which she showed me in 1975. She had been dissatisfied with what her social science students had to read. There were no Caribbean models, only things out of America and England.</font>	Transcription
1420.715188	1454.260257	<font color="navy">So she decided to write something about growing up in Jamaica so that her students could relate to it. What happened to it is that her students never got to it. The literary people appropriated it, and it has become a Carribean classic. But she, when I reached home in 1975, she had this manuscript and I read it and I said, This is magnificent what's going on here? So I made 12 copies and sent it out to some friends and had them comment on it. And Gordon Rohlehr, who is a quite famous Carribean critic was as excited as I was.</font>	Transcription
1454.260257	1474.119403	<font color="navy">And he said, 'Well, you know, this just has to come out'. He has a very slow delivery, but anyway. I was going to London for some other reason. And I took it with me on his advice to John La Rose, who publishes New Beacon, who grabbed it and published it. And that's the tale.</font>	Transcription
1473.595262	1474.876497	<font color="#008080">And the rest is history.</font>	Transcription
1474.527069	1500.151774	<font color="navy">The rest is history. Since then, La Rose, New Beacon has published two other novels of hers and what have you. She has continued writing and she's writing-- she also has continued writing academic things. She has had four academic manuscripts already in one year. Two are out already, and two are in press. And she has a novel coming. She's a very prolific writer, so.</font>	Transcription
1500.151774	1513.954172	<font color="#008080">Tell me about the two of you as writers. Do you often give feedback regarding manuscripts to each other? Or does she not dare that you get your hands on another one of hers before she decides what to do with it?</font>	Transcription, Question
1511.216988	1545.460912	<font color="navy">No. The thing is, the answer is yes and no, because it never works quite like that. Because we have so many other things to deal with, family matters, all kinds of down to earth things. But I mentioned in the foreword to one of her books, which she intended to send for you, but Ivan came, so she couldn't get from-- to me. So I didn't see her before I came, so. But she says you will get a package with all of them. She'll just wait till the four come out. Four [inaudible], yes.</font>	Transcription
1545.460912	1579.937788	<font color="navy">But she decided, well, one of my brothers and I decided that she should not be so poor, when she's so bright. So we thought a series of lectures and this became lectures and a meal. You go to Woodside on a Sunday, you pay a certain amount of money, and you'll get a lecture and a meal. Well, not many people were interested in this kind of lecture because it was really about Jamaican history and sociology, but written in such a way that the man in the street could understand it.</font>	Transcription
1579.937788	1611.735718	<font color="navy">Was about 10 lectures, and she really worked very hard, preparing them and reading all this stuff. First few, maybe she had 10 people and then maybe five and then soon it was just my brother and I. So, anyway, what she got out of it was she put this set of lectures together. Something about I can't remember the whole title, it ends in 'Consciousness', though. And one book is those 12 lectures put together. So in that way, I have benefited. I mean, I just sit and listen to her in awe.</font>	Transcription
1611.735718	1635.496808	<font color="navy">I don't have to read all that stuff, because she has read it. And I just read what she has produced for the man in the street, and so. Or, well, let me see how I benefit from it. I, last year I was an online consultant, I think, for a literature course at Fairleigh Dickinson University.</font>	Transcription
1635.496808	1661.412703	<font color="navy">So when they asked me a question that I didn't understand, you're online so you don't have to answer immediately. I would telephone her and get the absolute accurate answer. Something about, say Kamau Brathwaite in the '70s before I came back to Jamaica, and she would know. So I would get absolutely the right answer. And let me say in terms of an earlier question, what does it feel like to be part of this community of writers?</font>	Transcription
1661.412703	1686.455028	<font color="navy">What it really, how it really works is that they are accessible to me. If I want to remember a line of Walcott, say. I was writing an article on the sewing machine, which is one of my favorite articles now. And I called, I picked-- I knew Walcott said something about it and I just called Eddie Baugh. And I could get the page and the-- everything. I don't have to... I have the books upstairs.</font>	Transcription
1686.455028	1688.842785	<font color="#008080">You don't have to go to Google, or the internet.</font>	Transcription
1687.794502	1699.383857	<font color="navy">No. And then Google wouldn't be able to give me such a precise thing. So, or I call Mervyn Morris, you know, somebody-- people think I have a lot of informations I don't really have. What I have is who to ask. Yes. And they're just there. I leave a message on the machine. And the answer comes back. So they're all very useful to me. I can't tell you how useful they are in those terms.</font>	Transcription
1698.393812	1699.383857	<font color="#008080">The friends, the friends.</font>	Transcription
1699.383857	1709.983167	<font color="navy">Yes. And they're just there. I leave a message on the machine. And the answer comes back. So they're all very useful to me. I can't tell you how useful they are in those terms.</font>	Transcription
1709.284311	1723.319661	<font color="#008080">Velma, when you were talking about Erna, I wanted to ask you about the poet in the West Indies such as yourself. Erna, we know she's writing prose, but it's so poetic. She certainly--</font>	Transcription
1722.737281	1724.542658	<font color="navy">And she wrote poetry before, I mean.</font>	Transcription
1723.902041	1754.651687	<font color="#008080">Certainly one of the poets. Are you, by and large, forced to go abroad to America or to Canada or to England to have certain kinds of opportunities and support? Economic support. Is it very difficult? Is this why so many of the writers, most of them indeed, live else-- Many of them certainly live elsewhere for much of their careers?</font>	Transcription, Question
1754.651687	1767.114612	<font color="navy">No, well, these people you asked me about, my set, we are poets and writers after whatever else we are, and that came up in today's, one of the lectures today.</font>	Transcription
1767.114612	1768.337609	<font color="#008080">Which is very much the same here.</font>	Transcription
1768.337609	1788.837373	<font color="navy">Yes, we are all something else. Olive is seen as a journalist. I keep saying to people who talk about making your living by poetry that if Walcott had enough money, I don't think he would be working still. He's still lecturing in two universities. I mean, and if he can't make a living off it who can?</font>	Transcription
1788.837373	1790.700988	<font color="#008080">After a MacArthur and a Nobel.</font>	Transcription
1790.700988	1816.675121	<font color="navy">Yes, which money he has just spent. Not frittered away but, you know, even if you just live the money goes, you know? So I don't think there's-- I don't know any poet, certainly any Caribbean poet, who makes a living off poetry. Poetry, nobody even wants to buy poetry. We can try with the novels maybe and even that, you know, but nobody's making money off literature, none of them.</font>	Transcription
1816.675121	1836.417792	<font color="navy">And the business of going abroad too-- I think the going abroad is the generation before mine. Lamming and people like that who saw opportunity, and then not all of them, because some of those writers went abroad for different reasons, nothing to do with writing at all. And those of us--</font>	Transcription
1835.951888	1838.164931	<font color="#008080">And return, like Vic Reid, [inaudible].</font>	Transcription
1837.524313	1867.69158	<font color="navy">Well, Vic Reid just went very briefly, I mean he stayed in the Caribbean, he went to Canada on one of these scholarships one time, but if you can make your living, you tend to stay. And I'm saying that those who go when-- mostly not because they were writers, but because whatever they were doing, they would make a better living abroad. Those of us who come for once a year or so a semester here or there, come to get US money. It's sixty by one. Sixty Jamaican dollars for one US dollar.</font>	Transcription
1866.876248	1868.041007	<font color="#008080">We should certainly--</font>	Transcription
1866.876248	1882.600499	Hey Daryl, [inaudible] there's about time for one more question. And you may have even [inaudible] a follow-up [inaudible]. I was thinking, did you also ask her, since you see yourself as something else and a writer, like, where do you find the time? How do you, what's the muse? How do you--?	Transcription
1882.600499	1892.209763	<font color="#008080">Well, what I was thinking about asking, and you can decide what you rather-- to give you a chance. She does so many other things, the work on Rastafarianism, for example, and that sort of thing that we haven't touched upon at all.</font>	Transcription
1892.209763	1893.258047	<font color="navy">Okay, yeah.</font>	Transcription
1893.258047	1896.169945	<font color="#008080">If you want to talk about about that.</font>	Transcription
1896.461135	1898.61594	<font color="navy">Okay, that's a good question. </font>	Transcription
1898.266512	1899.314795	<font color="#008080">Is that okay?</font>	Transcription
1899.314795	1900.828982	Yeah. I mean let's try and get both of them in, because I mean maybe--	Transcription
1900.596031	1901.702552	<font color="#008080">Okay, what was the other one?</font>	Transcription
1901.702552	1906.943969	Was, since you do other things, where is also, as an answer to that,	Transcription
1907.701062	1912.418338	Yeah. How do you how do you fit into your life, the writing, how does it happen?	Transcription
1910.904151	1934.898193	<font color="#008080">And then you can get that into this too. Okay. Velma, as someone who's-- mother, grandmother, who's worked as an educator, a teacher, a dean, someone who is a poet, a short story writer, a novelist, a linguist, where do you find the time? And how do you fit all of these into your schedule? </font>	Transcription, Question
1933.849909	1966.404932	<font color="navy">Now, when you put it like that it sounds like a lot of things. And almost as if, really, how can I fit it in. But if I were a carpenter, I would still have had to be making things. In other words, the career bit is just there. And I appreciate the fact that I write, because when I-- if I get home, and I'm really fed up with all those meetings, and all the rest of it, I always have something on a yellow pad that needs typing out.</font>	Transcription
1967.453216	1984.749892	<font color="navy">Something that has not been neated up before. So I usually just go to the yellow pad, and now that there is a computer, before that it was a typewriter, and try to type out something neat. And I think that that really calms me. And it's a haven to me to move into my creative self.</font>	Transcription
1984.749892	2005.540846	<font color="navy">And I have written poetry and short fiction a lot. I only wrote the novel, the year I got sabbatical. Before the year began, I had a summer, in a workshop, the University of Miami, and I started the novel and finished it during the year. I've never had that kind of time again. And so I have not written another novel.</font>	Transcription
2005.540846	2036.63992	<font color="navy">But, and I've been very-- when I was dean, I was very resentful. I'm always resentful of administration because I hate it. And because I hate it, I have to try to do it well. And so it takes up all my time. And I, so I started writing something called In Spite of Miss Dean, when I was dean to show that in those four years or three years, I still-- so I wrote a set of vignettes, you may call them because they had to be short. The time was so small. In Spite of Miss Dean.</font>	Transcription
2036.63992	2071.990365	<font color="navy">Well, poetry. I write more poetry than prose, I think, because poetry can keep on going on in your head while you are working while you are washing while you are cooking. The poetry goes on, and then you get a little minute, you scribble it down and leave it. And then you get another minute and you revise it, so I always have poems being revised. I have a folder that every-- whenever I have a minute I just pick up that folder. So that I may have written a poem six months ago, and I haven't seen it for a while until I have a chance when I pick up the folder that's on top, I just revise all of them. So one, </font>	Transcription
2071.990365	2074.319884	<font color="#008080">So you may be working on five or six at a time?</font>	Transcription, Question
2072.572745	2098.080974	<font color="navy">So one-- Poems, right. So and they're like 10 thick as I do the revised versions. So when people tell me, 'Oh, I just scribbled a poem, do you want to hear it'? I say no. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything you just scribbled. When I write down something I have to go over it so many times that I don't want to hear anything you-- So the business of fitting in is that its not that the time is there. As I say I always have the paper and I write the stuff. </font>	Transcription
2098.080974	2117.532455	<font color="navy">Now, the business of <i>Dread Talk</i>. I came home in 1975. I had been interested in Rasta before, but I had not lived in Jamaica in my post-University state. And I started going to meetings and Rasta was all around me and I am in linguistics.</font>	Transcription
2117.532455	2150.262192	<font color="navy">And I discovered that the academic world outside was coming to the Caribbean, and writing long papers on very small things, things that I wouldn't have thought were worthy of writing about. So I said, I'm gonna write about dread talk. Whereby-- and I mean, I've just kept on writing about it. Now I'm, the last thing I wrote about was, it's a collaborative work myself and our Cuban linguist about dread talk in Cuba, which is coming out in a journal. [Inaudible].</font>	Transcription
2149.621574	2153.75647	<font color="#008080">Well Velma, thank you so much for this opportunity. It's been wonderful to chat with you.</font>	Transcription
2153.75647	2155.037705	<font color="navy">It's been my pleasure.</font>	Transcription
2156.668368	2159.813219	You guys are great, I mean I, like, have nothing to say.	Transcription
2157.716652	2159.289077	Pull back and get a wide shot.	Transcription
2159.813219	2161.735071	Get the wide shot.	Transcription
2161.735071	2164.414018	Oh yeah, if you guys would just talk to each other.	Transcription
2164.181066	2167.034726	<font color="navy">Yes, yeah. Well, what else have we not said?</font>	Transcription
2165.578777	2168.898341	<font color="#008080">When I [inaudible] my voice last year I was so worried about this.</font>	Transcription
2168.607152	2183.399595	<font color="navy">No, no we haven't mentioned the grandchildren. But anyway, they got left out, but next tiiime-- we would never stop, right. Got it? Yes, okay. Well.</font>	Transcription
2172.334381	2175.304518	<font color="#008080">But if we started on that it would take up the whole time.</font>	Transcription
2184.040213	2186.195017	<font color="#008080">So now the voice for tomorrow.</font>	Transcription
2185.962065	2191.26172	<font color="navy">Yes. You have to save it tonight. You can't stand in the car and everybody comes to talk to you.</font>	Transcription
2189.514581	2197.143755	<font color="#008080">I really-- I know. That's why I'm staying away from some things, but I think I'm going to come back to his poetry readings. </font>	Transcription
2196.852565	2198.075562	<font color="navy">Yes, tonight, yes.</font>	Transcription
2197.667897	2199.939177	<font color="#008080">That'll give me a chance to just sit and not talk.</font>	Transcription
2199.939177	2202.035744	<font color="#008080">Yes, because you can't talk while they're reading.</font>	Transcription
2202.035744	2210.014346	<font color="#008080">Yeah, because the more I talk, the more problems I have. Can I [inaudible]? Okay.</font>	Transcription
2209.373728	2211.470295	Thank you all for the great interview.	Transcription
2210.014346	2211.470295	<font color="#008080">Thank you so much.</font>	Transcription
2211.703247	2213.217434	I [inaudible].	Transcription
