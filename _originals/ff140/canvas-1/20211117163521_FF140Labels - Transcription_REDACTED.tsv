16.539582	20.383288	Velma Pollard, P-o-l-l-a-r-d.
24.285232	32.787975	Velma, tell me what it means to you as a poet, and as a West Indian poet, to be a part of this Furious Flower conference.
33.661545	64.760619	I am overwhelmed. I am flattered. I feel very special. I don't know why me. Chance is something else. If Joanne Gabbin had never met me, she would never have heard my name. If she didn't know you, she would never have met me. Because it's through you that she met me. If you had never come to Jamaica, you would never have met me. So it's chance, all the time.
64.236477	65.983616	Everything, I suppose.
65.750664	67.090137	And I'm grateful.
67.090137	74.719311	Have you personally been affected by African American poets and poetry, in your own development as a poet? 
75.476404	99.528684	I don't know that I can say my own development as a poet, but certainly as a person. And it's hard for me to think what has affected me as a poet. But it's much easier for me to understand what has affected me as a person. I came upon African American poetry, and literature generally, seriously in 1968.
99.528684	123.231537	When I got a little work, in Harlem, in a storefront homework center, where I was supervising homework for children who didn't have parents who could do homework with them. I hired some undergraduates from Hunter College. And every afternoon, we supervised homework.
123.231537	143.556587	This was my first time living in America. And I thought I need to know about this culture. I don't know. I knew hardly anything about it, except for the big names that everybody had read. And so I started to read. And I read and read and read, and a whole other world was opened up to me.
143.556587	150.021001	Wonderful. Could you tell me about other influences, early influences, family, place, home, school.
149.20567	178.208177	I think well, home, school, I think school. I think that I was impressed early in terms of poetry by some of the, I suppose some of the big names. I have to say that John Donne, although he was a religious man, to some extent, and an English man, and all the rest of it. But I think that very early in life I identified Donne as somebody who I related to.
178.208177	193.932428	His passion, he was a man who was as passionate about a woman as he was about Christ. I mean, some of that poetry moved me as early in high school as I could remember. So that's where I remember first.
193.932428	214.49043	You know, when I was at UWI, University of the West Indies in 1978, I always felt such a sense of awe to be in the presence of so many literary people. And I'd just like to know what it meant to you to go to school there, to work there from all those years from the 1950s onward,
214.49043	247.045453	and to associate with notables at one time or another, such as Derek Walcott, Orlando Patterson, Jean D'Costa, Garth St. Omer, Sylvia Wynter, John Hearne, Slade Hopkinson, Mervyn Morris, Kamau Brathwaite, Olive Senior, Pamela Mordecai, Lorna Goodison, Vic Reid, Louise Bennett, Ken Ramchand, Rex Nettleford, Eddie Baugh, Dennis Scott, Tony McNeill, Lorna Goodison, and of course your sister Erna Brodber. What's it like to interact with-- 
246.812501	255.839386	The thing is that I am lucky that as you were calling those names, I was thinking-- I have never, I don't think of any of them as literary people, or artists.
254.558151	258.227143	But you can't think of West Indian literature without thinking of--
257.237097	285.133083	But I don't think of West Indian literature. Those people are all people that I have known. I mean, I went to university with Eddie Baugh, Mervyn Morris, Garth St. Omer, the lot of them. The things I remember about them are unspeakable. They wouldn't want to remember the things that I remember about them. You know? I remember Garth St. Omer jumping over a fence to prevent me from doing something I would have been unhappy to have done. To go and spy on somebody. And he just stopped me and said you are not going.
285.133083	305.458133	I don't remember that he has written novels, I remember that. You know, or I remember walking home from the union with Slade Hopkinson and those guys and just-- people mocking each other's accents because we're all from different islands. Things like that that are not at all literary. So because I knew all these people before they became important, it--
305.458133	310.583074	Well in later years tell me about interactions. I know you've collaborated, 
310.583074	336.790159	Yeah, well the interaction at this-- now when I came back onto the campus, and all my little friends were now important people, this was awe. I remember going to an eight o'clock class to hear Mervyn Morris lecture and losing my one gold earring. And I said now, why was I even at that lecture at eight in the morning, who invited me? But I didn't know Mervyn as a lecturer or anything.
336.790159	366.84095	Or going to hear Eddie Baugh. Talk about Brathwaite's-- there's this poem called <i>Rights [of Passage]</i>. Eddie Baugh gave a phenomenal lecture on <i>Rights</i>. And he read from that poem. You know, Eddie Baugh's voice is the best thing in the Caribbean. Reading Kamau Brathwaite. That was like 19-- I came back in 1975. So that may have been '75 or '76. And I recognized that the little people that I had known, had grown. They had become mountains.
366.84095	367.889233	Do you remember where you--?
367.481567	368.413375	I said-- hmm?
368.413375	374.936027	I'm sorry, do you remember where you were when you found out that Derek was a Nobel Laureate?
374.936027	400.32778	I must have heard about it before I saw it on the-- I can't remember where I heard. I know that I was at the TV to watch him receive the prize. And I really was overwhelmed. Well, the first thing I did when I heard that he got it, I phoned a young American scholar who I know who had told me that he would never get it because of <i>The Boston Sun</i>. 
398.580641	399.628925	Oh yes.
400.32778	433.406945	And I said, people know that it's not his private life that they're giving him the prize for. In any case, most West Indians don't believe that story <i>in that way</i>. Because people in the Caribbean are accustomed to saying things to people that they don't really mean all the time. I read Walcott's poetry, and I see some of it and I read the way that people analyze it, and the high sounding words they say about it.
433.406945	464.680733	And I say-- I'll give you one quick example. This is one of my favorite Walcott poems. It is, I think it's called <i>The Light of the World</i>. A lot of people have written a lot about it, it's supposed to be a poem from which another life came or something. All kinds of things have been said about it. But the lines where he says, 'O beauty, you are the light of the world!' Oh, they have gone to Italy, they have gone to everywhere, to assess it.
436.202368	437.949507	Yes, please.
464.680733	489.257155	And I know that Caribbean men say things like this to women all the time. Oh, lady, Moses must have been sleeping when one like you left heaven. Who knows if Moses was even in heaven? But that kind of thing is said, so 'O beauty, you are the light of the world!'. And I say, you know, they've said everything about it but they have not said this is a man as they would say in Ghana souring a woman.
489.257155	502.768363	Yes, yes. You know, Velma, when you told me about that, it reminded me of what I know once about you're giving a book to a publisher, and his offering to have somebody check the Creole for you.
501.894794	502.768363	Yes!
502.768363	513.425911	Talk a little bit about responses from so called, 'First World' publishers and critics and so forth to either your own word or other--
513.425911	535.090434	Well, in this case, the person they were asking to check my Creole-- unfortunately, I had heard her give a lecture, and her English was not so hot. So I wrote back and I told them that what I did for a living was teach people about Creole. Had they known that they may not have suggested this.
535.090434	566.131271	And I said, if you don't want to publish the book, that's fine. But I'm not going to change anything. And since I had tested it and found somebody who does not speak the Creole who was a Canadian visitor who didn't have a problem with it. I can write an explanation about the use of the Creole. And so I wrote the afterword, and that satisfied them. Generally speaking, I think it has been a bit of a battle that was won before I started writing seriously, was half won.
566.131271	596.356775	The other thing, and here I'm quoting Olive Senior to a certain extent, she was saying once-- and I don't doubt that she remembers saying it-- that she's glad that she was already a professional in her own right before she became well known as a writer. And I think I can't use the well known for myself, but I can say that I am also glad that I had sort of made my name professionally before, so that I could stand up and say, if you don't want to publish my book, well, that's fine, but this is the situation.
596.356775	603.927711	And to some degree, I guess the generation of Vic Reid and Sam Selvon and those people, yeah, paved the way. Exactly.
599.851053	604.80128	They paved the way for us. This is why I say we benefited from what they did. Yes.
604.80128	614.410545	Velma, let's talk a little bit about your creative process. I remember once you told me you started out writing everything down on a yellow pad. Is that still the way you work?
614.410545	643.47129	I thought this morning as I was sitting in front of you writing in my yellow pad, that maybe you know that a poem is coming, yes. I do not travel without the yellow pad. Sometimes it's not yellow, sometimes it's white because sometimes I can't find a yellow pad, but it's mostly yellow-- and a pencil. I don't know why but I really-- I think that what I get from that is the immediacy. When I get a thought like what I was writing this morning, it is immediate.
643.47129	665.659955	So when I go back to it, I'm responding to something that was, what Houston Baker just called the... impulse? I like that term. If you wait to write at the computer, or at your desk, you are going to lose that. First thing, I don't have the kind of memory that would ever take things with me into when I get comfortable.
665.659955	693.148275	So when it was not the yellow pad, it was a note paper at the kitchen table when I had less time for myself. And I was always busy. And even now if I go to sleep, I always have a pencil and a page. I fold the computer sheet the used sheets over. And I always have that and a pencil on my bed. I may write something to buy in the supermarket tomorrow, or I may write a line.
693.148275	697.283171	But when you say, when you had less time for yourself are you speaking of when you had a family?
697.283171	703.339919	Bringing up children working on, you know, doing more things than I should have to do. Yes, that's--
703.339919	713.473325	Would you share with us one of your favorite poems and tell us a little something about its history and its composition?
712.075614	741.718739	Well, I'm not sure that this is my favorite poem, but I think it's other people's, because it is my most anthologized poem. And it did come out in the first six or so poems that I had published. So it's an old poem. Pam Mordecai put together, Pam Mordecai and Mervyn Morris put together <i>Jamaica Woman</i> in 1980 before any of the women in here had their own collections out yet, and this was included. It's called <i>Fly</i>.
741.718739	785.571928	[REDACTED]
785.571928	804.091601	[REDACTED]
804.091601	814.516197	[REDACTED]
814.516197	846.19765	[REDACTED]
846.19765	850.099594	Is that an autobiographical poem?
849.808404	873.860684	The thing is, it might be, but I really do not know. Because I think I may have started out by thinking 'ef a ketch im/ a mash im/ ef a ketch im/ a mash im', which is the way the train goes up the hill in Jamaica, 'ef a ketch im/ a mash im/ ef a ketch im/ a mash im'. And our trains have to-- used to, we have no trains now-- used to go up very steep hills.
873.860684	895.932874	I think it started with a notion that when we were saying it in elementary school, we were not really listening to the words, that it is a cruel refrain. In other words, if anybody's on the train line, when the train is coming, the person is going to die. So, 'ef a ketch im/ a mash im'. I think that's where it started that kind of realization.
895.932874	899.543628	But no thought of the woman entrapped by the rails.
899.1942	901.174291	And then, I was about to say,
900.766625	901.523718	Oh, I'm sorry.
901.523718	930.40975	it moves to the woman entrapped. And not just me, but all other women, I mean, running for that trap rushing to get to the point where you want to go to the cinema but you have to go home to cook. Women rush to get to it. And then they realize. Too late, I suppose. It is a very cynical poem but I didn't think it was cynical when I was writing it. But the more I read it, the more it sounds cynical.
930.40975	935.127025	Is it simply that you've moved on to another period so that you aren't quite the feminist?
934.428169	935.359977	As trapped?
935.359977	939.611348	Well, quite the feminist that I think I hear there.
939.611348	954.46203	Well, and people accuse me of that. But I don't know if feminist is just realist. Perhaps reality is what they call feminism, you know, just describing the truth.
955.102647	958.655163	Okay. And talk a little bit about Anansi, and using that--
958.655163	990.686045	Anansi. Well, you know, Anansi is the patron saint of insects in a sense. Anansi, and I've used Anansi a lot. I have a collection called <i>Ananses??m</i> which is a word for Anansi stories, a word from Twi in Ghana. Anansi came to us from Twi, from the Akan tradition, he is both a spider and a god. For some reason, in Jamaica, he took on a trickster personality.
990.686045	1021.319215	But, and a trickster personality that I consider to have been much maligned. Anansi gets the better of people, but gets the better of people by finding their Achilles heel. I mean, snake was so proud of his length and power and what have you. Anansi humbled him by just discovering, you know, what really was at the heart of his notions about himself, and using it.
1021.319215	1040.595982	So we have all this blame for Anansi. Anansi tricks people and all the rest of it, but Anansi only tricks people who can be tricked. Anansi, I cry. I'm warning them, Look, don't come into this net. But only if you can listen, will you hear. So that's, that's Anansi.
1040.595982	1061.328698	They always talk about Caribbean people, and the Anansi-ism. I'm sure you've heard of it up here, where we come and in no time we have a house and whatever. And it's all because of our tricks. But I think Anansi is about taking opportunity when it offers itself, and just looking around and making sure that you see it. 
1061.328698	1062.726409	And much industry.
1062.726409	1088.292876	And much industry. Anansi, I think, is part of a migrant personality, it need not be a West Indian coming to America or going to England, it could be any migrant going anywhere. And that same person at home is quite laid back. People from here come to the Caribbean just to comment on how laid back we are. And then they meet us up here and say how industrious we are. It's the same people. Different situation.
1087.419307	1098.076855	And you know, our Brer Rabbit is brother to Anansi. The very same tales as a matter of fact, of African origin obviously, are told here with Brer Rabbit.
1089.748826	1092.48601	Yeah, right. Yes, I know.
1098.076855	1101.338181	Maybe a different folk tradition within Africa.
1101.338181	1120.498472	Exactly. Exactly. Velma, your latest collection of poetry seems so much more reflective about the concerns of aging, and even dying. And I suppose that is a kind of natural progression as we age and experience the deaths of our parents and friends and what have you.
1120.498472	1141.17295	But one in particular, I want to ask you about though you may say something generally about the subject matter and your interest in the kind of subject matter that we see in your poems more recently. But one poem, <i>We Are Our Grandmother's</i> concludes, 'I know that I am grand'. Talk a little bit about what you're saying there. 
1138.668717	1163.652805	Gran. Well, that is really harking back to the short story that is not so short about <i>Gran</i>, which is about, which is perhaps my only autobiographical piece about my grandmother. And this is a woman who really, I have always had a great respect for. When her husband died she had seven children: one was nine, the oldest, and the youngest was nine months.
1163.652805	1192.13117	And she-- now, she was not poverty-stricken, I have to admit. There was land, there was a mill and copper, which is what they used to make sugar. But all of that stuff her husband was in charge of and he just died quite suddenly. And I remember her at the mill and copper, giving orders to men so much taller and bigger than she was. And just getting out there at six o'clock every morning and doing what had to be done and,
1192.13117	1230.451752	She's established herself as a baker so she was baking, she was selling sugar where people would come to the boiling house to but by the sugar in these pans, sort of, and making sure there was enough money to put all the children through school. So whenever I see myself doing something and people say, how do you manage that? I know that I'm not doing much, I'm doing a quarter of what she did. But in a sense I am Gran. And I'm not sure which bit of Alice Walker's work I had read. Why I dedicated it to her. Oh, she said, 'We are all grandmothers'. Yes, yes, that's it. That's how that came--
1230.451752	1241.808156	You once said that Gran is an excuse to 'big up' a strong female symbol of Jamaican peasantocracy. How important do you see that still, in Jamaican society?
1241.808156	1273.664323	I see its lack, still. And I think that a lot of the people who have gone astray now have not had access to this kind of person, nor respect for this kind of person. Everybody wants to get rich very quickly. My grandmother had to do lots of things so that my mother could have a profession, so that she could want me to have a profession. Everybody wants to be well off, or to get where I am, and that's not being that well off, but comfortable. Everybody wants to get comfortable in one generation.
1273.664323	1298.415459	People long ago sacrificed, knowing that the next generation would benefit. Nobody is willing to sacrifice now. That's why we have in Jamaica, young women leaving their babies at home to go to dances. Do you know how many children die by fire in my country, because their mothers went to a dance? Went to a dance, and left the children there.
1298.415459	1313.790282	So it's a kind of-- I think that we need to get back to saying, not that we want them to be downtrodden or anything, but we just want people to take responsibility and to know that there were people who take responsibility.
1313.790282	1350.654915	And the word 'peasantocracy', I like it. Because an academic, a social scientist on the campus, spoke tongue in cheek of my sister and I said, ha, they're not poor people my dear, those are from the peasantocray. And what he meant is that we grew up in the country and people think, 'where did they even learn to read books?' But there were books, and there was knife and fork and doilies and all these little things that you expect in homes of people who have money. So that -ocracy, peasantocracy, he labels for people like us who behave as if we...
1350.189011	1351.761436	Came from the aristocracy?
1351.761436	1357.701709	But we don't really. They are from right down there, the peasanto--. So it is a put down, but a nice put down.
1357.701709	1367.485687	Well, speaking of your sister, we certainly have to get to that famous writer as well. And I'd love for you to share my favorite story, about
1367.485687	1370.339347	Oh, you mean how <i>Jane and Louisa</i> came to be published.
1370.339347	1376.862	Exactly, <i>Jane and Louisa</i>, of course, is one of the classics of modern Carribean literature, yes.
1373.484197	1375.056623	Of Carribean literature.
1376.862	1378.434425	Well, my sister is a social scientist.
1378.434425	1381.113371	Can I interrupt? Could you say your sister's full name? [Inaudible] want to hear it.
1381.113371	1397.18705	I'll say it. Yes. Well Erna Brodber is my sister. B-r-o-d-b-e-r is my maiden name and her name. She's a social-- a historian, a social scientist, and what have you.
1397.18705	1420.715188	And she had been well known in that she's written things like abandonment of children, yards in the City of Kingston. And that's how she made her name. And then she came up with this volume, which she showed me in 1975. She had been dissatisfied with what her social science students had to read. There were no Caribbean models, only things out of America and England.
1420.715188	1454.260257	So she decided to write something about growing up in Jamaica so that her students could relate to it. What happened to it is that her students never got to it. The literary people appropriated it, and it has become a Carribean classic. But she, when I reached home in 1975, she had this manuscript and I read it and I said, This is magnificent what's going on here? So I made 12 copies and sent it out to some friends and had them comment on it. And Gordon Rohlehr, who is a quite famous Carribean critic was as excited as I was.
1454.260257	1474.119403	And he said, 'Well, you know, this just has to come out'. He has a very slow delivery, but anyway. I was going to London for some other reason. And I took it with me on his advice to John La Rose, who publishes New Beacon, who grabbed it and published it. And that's the tale.
1473.595262	1474.876497	And the rest is history.
1474.527069	1500.151774	The rest is history. Since then, La Rose, New Beacon has published two other novels of hers and what have you. She has continued writing and she's writing-- she also has continued writing academic things. She has had four academic manuscripts already in one year. Two are out already, and two are in press. And she has a novel coming. She's a very prolific writer, so.
1500.151774	1513.954172	Tell me about the two of you as writers. Do you often give feedback regarding manuscripts to each other? Or does she not dare that you get your hands on another one of hers before she decides what to do with it?
1511.216988	1545.460912	No. The thing is, the answer is yes and no, because it never works quite like that. Because we have so many other things to deal with, family matters, all kinds of down to earth things. But I mentioned in the foreword to one of her books, which she intended to send for you, but Ivan came, so she couldn't get from-- to me. So I didn't see her before I came, so. But she says you will get a package with all of them. She'll just wait till the four come out. Four [inaudible], yes.
1545.460912	1579.937788	But she decided, well, one of my brothers and I decided that she should not be so poor, when she's so bright. So we thought a series of lectures and this became lectures and a meal. You go to Woodside on a Sunday, you pay a certain amount of money, and you'll get a lecture and a meal. Well, not many people were interested in this kind of lecture because it was really about Jamaican history and sociology, but written in such a way that the man in the street could understand it.
1579.937788	1611.735718	Was about 10 lectures, and she really worked very hard, preparing them and reading all this stuff. First few, maybe she had 10 people and then maybe five and then soon it was just my brother and I. So, anyway, what she got out of it was she put this set of lectures together. Something about I can't remember the whole title, it ends in 'Consciousness', though. And one book is those 12 lectures put together. So in that way, I have benefited. I mean, I just sit and listen to her in awe.
1611.735718	1635.496808	I don't have to read all that stuff, because she has read it. And I just read what she has produced for the man in the street, and so. Or, well, let me see how I benefit from it. I, last year I was an online consultant, I think, for a literature course at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
1635.496808	1661.412703	So when they asked me a question that I didn't understand, you're online so you don't have to answer immediately. I would telephone her and get the absolute accurate answer. Something about, say Kamau Brathwaite in the '70s before I came back to Jamaica, and she would know. So I would get absolutely the right answer. And let me say in terms of an earlier question, what does it feel like to be part of this community of writers?
1661.412703	1686.455028	What it really, how it really works is that they are accessible to me. If I want to remember a line of Walcott, say. I was writing an article on the sewing machine, which is one of my favorite articles now. And I called, I picked-- I knew Walcott said something about it and I just called Eddie Baugh. And I could get the page and the-- everything. I don't have to... I have the books upstairs.
1686.455028	1688.842785	You don't have to go to Google, or the internet.
1687.794502	1709.983167	No. And then Google wouldn't be able to give me such a precise thing. So, or I call Mervyn Morris, you know, somebody-- people think I have a lot of informations I don't really have. What I have is who to ask. Yes. And they're just there. I leave a message on the machine. And the answer comes back. So they're all very useful to me. I can't tell you how useful they are in those terms.
1698.393812	1699.383857	The friends, the friends.
1709.284311	1723.319661	Velma, when you were talking about Erna, I wanted to ask you about the poet in the West Indies such as yourself. Erna, we know she's writing prose, but it's so poetic. She certainly--
1722.737281	1724.542658	And she wrote poetry before, I mean.
1723.902041	1754.651687	Certainly one of the poets. Are you, by and large, forced to go abroad to America or to Canada or to England to have certain kinds of opportunities and support? Economic support. Is it very difficult? Is this why so many of the writers, most of them indeed, live else-- Many of them certainly live elsewhere for much of their careers?
1754.651687	1767.114612	No, well, these people you asked me about, my set, we are poets and writers after whatever else we are, and that came up in today's, one of the lectures today.
1767.114612	1768.337609	Which is very much the same here.
1768.337609	1788.837373	Yes, we are all something else. Olive is seen as a journalist. I keep saying to people who talk about making your living by poetry that if Walcott had enough money, I don't think he would be working still. He's still lecturing in two universities. I mean, and if he can't make a living off it who can?
1788.837373	1790.700988	After a MacArthur and a Nobel.
1790.700988	1816.675121	Yes, which money he has just spent. Not frittered away but, you know, even if you just live the money goes, you know? So I don't think there's-- I don't know any poet, certainly any Caribbean poet, who makes a living off poetry. Poetry, nobody even wants to buy poetry. We can try with the novels maybe and even that, you know, but nobody's making money off literature, none of them.
1816.675121	1836.417792	And the business of going abroad too-- I think the going abroad is the generation before mine. Lamming and people like that who saw opportunity, and then not all of them, because some of those writers went abroad for different reasons, nothing to do with writing at all. And those of us--
1835.951888	1838.164931	And return, like Vic Reid, [inaudible].
1837.524313	1867.69158	Well, Vic Reid just went very briefly, I mean he stayed in the Caribbean, he went to Canada on one of these scholarships one time, but if you can make your living, you tend to stay. And I'm saying that those who go when-- mostly not because they were writers, but because whatever they were doing, they would make a better living abroad. Those of us who come for once a year or so a semester here or there, come to get US money. It's sixty by one. Sixty Jamaican dollars for one US dollar.
1866.876248	1868.041007	We should certainly--
1866.876248	1882.600499	Hey Daryl, [inaudible] there's about time for one more question. And you may have even [inaudible] a follow-up [inaudible]. I was thinking, did you also ask her, since you see yourself as something else and a writer, like, where do you find the time? How do you, what's the muse? How do you--?
1882.600499	1896.169945	Well, what I was thinking about asking, and you can decide what you rather-- to give you a chance. She does so many other things, the work on Rastafarianism, for example, and that sort of thing that we haven't touched upon at all. If you want to talk about about that.
1892.209763	1893.258047	Okay, yeah.
1896.461135	1898.61594	Okay, that's a good question. 
1898.266512	1899.314795	Is that okay?
1899.314795	1900.828982	Yeah. I mean let's try and get both of them in, because I mean maybe-- 
1900.596031	1901.702552	Okay, what was the other one?
1901.702552	1906.943969	Was, since you do other things, where is also, as an answer to that,
1904.497974	1905.255068	[Inaudible]
1906.652779	1907.701062	Oh, the time.
1907.701062	1912.418338	Yeah. How do you how do you fit into your life, the writing, how does it happen?
1910.904151	1934.898193	And then you can get that into this too. Okay. Velma, as someone who's-- mother, grandmother, who's worked as an educator, a teacher, a dean, someone who is a poet, a short story writer, a novelist, a linguist, where do you find the time? And how do you fit all of these into your schedule? 
1933.849909	1966.404932	Now, when you put it like that it sounds like a lot of things. And almost as if, really, how can I fit it in. But if I were a carpenter, I would still have had to be making things. In other words, the career bit is just there. And I appreciate the fact that I write, because when I-- if I get home, and I'm really fed up with all those meetings, and all the rest of it, I always have something on a yellow pad that needs typing out.
1967.453216	1984.749892	Something that has not been neated up before. So I usually just go to the yellow pad, and now that there is a computer, before that it was a typewriter, and try to type out something neat. And I think that that really calms me. And it's a haven to me to move into my creative self.
1984.749892	2005.540846	And I have written poetry and short fiction a lot. I only wrote the novel, the year I got sabbatical. Before the year began, I had a summer, in a workshop, the University of Miami, and I started the novel and finished it during the year. I've never had that kind of time again. And so I have not written another novel.
2005.540846	2036.63992	But, and I've been very-- when I was dean, I was very resentful. I'm always resentful of administration because I hate it. And because I hate it, I have to try to do it well. And so it takes up all my time. And I, so I started writing something called In Spite of Miss Dean, when I was dean to show that in those four years or three years, I still-- so I wrote a set of vignettes, you may call them because they had to be short. The time was so small. In Spite of Miss Dean.
2036.63992	2071.990365	Well, poetry. I write more poetry than prose, I think, because poetry can keep on going on in your head while you are working while you are washing while you are cooking. The poetry goes on, and then you get a little minute, you scribble it down and leave it. And then you get another minute and you revise it, so I always have poems being revised. I have a folder that every-- whenever I have a minute I just pick up that folder. So that I may have written a poem six months ago, and I haven't seen it for a while until I have a chance when I pick up the folder that's on top, I just revise all of them. So one, 
2071.990365	2074.319884	So you may be working on five or six at a time?
2072.572745	2073.096887	So one--
2074.319884	2098.080974	Poems, right. So and they're like 10 thick as I do the revised versions. So when people tell me, 'Oh, I just scribbled a poem, do you want to hear it'? I say no. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything you just scribbled. When I write down something I have to go over it so many times that I don't want to hear anything you-- So the business of fitting in is that its not that the time is there. As I say I always have the paper and I write the stuff. 
2098.080974	2117.532455	Now, the business of <i>Dread Talk</i>. I came home in 1975. I had been interested in Rasta before, but I had not lived in Jamaica in my post-University state. And I started going to meetings and Rasta was all around me and I am in linguistics.
2117.532455	2150.262192	And I discovered that the academic world outside was coming to the Caribbean, and writing long papers on very small things, things that I wouldn't have thought were worthy of writing about. So I said, I'm gonna write about dread talk. Whereby-- and I mean, I've just kept on writing about it. Now I'm, the last thing I wrote about was, it's a collaborative work myself and our Cuban linguist about dread talk in Cuba, which is coming out in a journal. [Inaudible].
2149.621574	2153.75647	Well Velma, thank you so much for this opportunity. It's been wonderful to chat with you.
2153.75647	2155.037705	It's been my pleasure.
2156.668368	2159.813219	You guys are great, I mean I, like, have nothing to say. 
2157.716652	2159.289077	Pull back and get a wide shot.
2159.813219	2161.735071	Get the wide shot.
2161.735071	2164.414018	Oh yeah, if you guys would just talk to each other.
2164.181066	2167.034726	Yes, yeah. Well, what else have we not said?
2165.578777	2168.898341	When I [inaudible] my voice last year I was so worried about this.
2168.607152	2183.399595	No, no we haven't mentioned the grandchildren. But anyway, they got left out, but next tiiime-- we would never stop, right. Got it? Yes, okay. Well.
2172.334381	2175.304518	But if we started on that it would take up the whole time.
2184.040213	2186.195017	So now the voice for tomorrow.
2185.962065	2191.26172	Yes. You have to save it tonight. You can't stand in the car and everybody comes to talk to you.
2189.514581	2197.143755	I really-- I know. That's why I'm staying away from some things, but I think I'm going to come back to his poetry readings. 
2196.852565	2198.075562	Yes, tonight, yes.
2197.667897	2199.939177	That'll give me a chance to just sit and not talk.
2199.939177	2202.035744	Yes, because you can't talk while they're reading.
2202.035744	2210.014346	Yeah, because the more I talk, the more problems I have. Can I [inaudible]? Okay.
2209.373728	2211.470295	Thank you all for the great interview.
2210.014346	2211.470295	Thank you so much.
2211.703247	2213.217434	I [inaudible].
2212.16915	2213.217434	Do you guys--
