88.851	98.36	<font color='navy'>understand what has affected me as a person. I came upon African American poetry, and literature generally, seriously in 1968.</font>	Transcription
99.951	118.16	<font color='navy'>When I got a little work, in Harlem, in a storefront homework center, where I was supervising homework for children who didn&#39;t have parents who could do homework with them. I hired some undergraduates</font>	Transcription

161.481	178.1	<font color='navy'>although he was a religious man, to some extent, and an English man, and all the rest of it. But I think that very early in life I identified Donne as somebody who I related to.</font>	Transcription
178.611	191.96	<font color='navy'>His passion, he was a man who was as passionate about a woman as he was about Christ. I mean, some of that poetry moved me as early in high school as I could remember. So that&#39;s where I remember</font>	Transcription

513.511	528.54	<font color='navy'>Well, in this case, the person they were asking to check my Creole-- unfortunately, I had heard her give a lecture, and her English was not so hot. So I wrote back and I told them that</font>	Transcription
528.541	534.93	<font color='navy'>what I did for a living was teach people about Creole. Had they known that they may not have suggested this.</font>	Transcription
535.591	547.08	<font color='navy'>And I said, if you don&#39;t want to publish the book, that&#39;s fine. But I&#39;m not going to change anything. And since I had tested it and found somebody who does not speak the Creole who was a Canadian</font>	Transcription
547.081	560.49	<font color='navy'>visitor who didn&#39;t have a problem with it. I can write an explanation about the use of the Creole. And so I wrote the afterword, and that satisfied them. Generally speaking, I think it has been a bit</font>	Transcription
560.491	565.92	<font color='navy'>of a battle that was won before I started writing seriously, was half won.</font>	Transcription
566.791	577.8	<font color='navy'>The other thing, and here I&#39;m quoting Olive Senior to a certain extent, she was saying once-- and I don&#39;t doubt that she remembers saying it-- that she&#39;s glad that she was already a professional in</font>	Transcription
577.801	591.21	<font color='navy'>her own right before she became well known as a writer. And I think I can&#39;t use the well known for myself, but I can say that I am also glad that I had sort of made my name professionally before, so</font>	Transcription
591.211	596.25	<font color='navy'>that I could stand up and say, if you don&#39;t want to publish my book, well, that&#39;s fine, but this is the situation.</font>	Transcription

605.041	614.43	<font color='#008080'>Velma, let&#39;s talk a little bit about your creative process. I remember once you told me you started out writing everything down on a yellow pad. Is that still the way you work?</font>	Transcription
614.49	628.26	<font color='navy'><b>Velma Pollard</b></font>	Speaker
614.491	628.26	<font color='navy'>I thought this morning as I was sitting in front of you writing in my yellow pad, that maybe you know that a poem is coming, yes. I do not travel without the yellow pad. Sometimes it&#39;s</font>	Transcription
628.261	638.61	<font color='navy'>not yellow, sometimes it&#39;s white because sometimes I can&#39;t find a yellow pad, but it&#39;s mostly yellow-- and a pencil. I don&#39;t know why but I really-- I think that what I get from that is the immediacy.</font>	Transcription
639.361	643.2	<font color='navy'>When I get a thought like what I was writing this morning, it is immediate.</font>	Transcription
643.831	658.02	<font color='navy'>So when I go back to it, I&#39;m responding to something that was, what Houston Baker just called the... impulse? I like that term. If you wait to write at the computer, or at your desk, you are going to</font>	Transcription
658.021	665.46	<font color='navy'>lose that. First thing, I don&#39;t have the kind of memory that would ever take things with me into when I get comfortable.</font>	Transcription
666.451	679.89	<font color='navy'>So when it was not the yellow pad, it was a note paper at the kitchen table when I had less time for myself. And I was always busy. And even now if I go to sleep, I always have a pencil and a page. I</font>	Transcription
679.891	692.58	<font color='navy'>fold the computer sheet the used sheets over. And I always have that and a pencil on my bed. I may write something to buy in the supermarket tomorrow, or I may write a line.</font>	Transcription

958.72	969.28	<font color='navy'><b>Velma Pollard</b></font>	Speaker
958.721	969.28	<font color='navy'>Anansi. Well, you know, Anansi is the patron saint of insects in a sense. Anansi, and I&#39;ve used Anansi a lot. I have a collection called <i>Anansesɛm</i> which is a word for Anansi</font>	Transcription
969.281	990.55	<font color='navy'>stories, a word from Twi in Ghana. Anansi came to us from Twi, from the Akan tradition, he is both a spider and a god. For some reason, in Jamaica, he took on a trickster personality.</font>	Transcription
991.321	1006.26	<font color='navy'>But, and a trickster personality that I consider to have been much maligned. Anansi gets the better of people, but gets the better of people by finding their Achilles heel. I mean, snake was so proud</font>	Transcription
1006.261	1021.32	<font color='navy'>of his length and power and what have you. Anansi humbled him by just discovering, you know, what really was at the heart of his notions about himself, and using it.</font>	Transcription
1021.471	1033.68	<font color='navy'>So we have all this blame for Anansi. Anansi tricks people and all the rest of it, but Anansi only tricks people who can be tricked. Anansi, I cry. I&#39;m warning them, Look, don&#39;t come into this net.</font>	Transcription
1034.131	1040.76	<font color='navy'>But only if you can listen, will you hear. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s Anansi.</font>	Transcription
1040.881	1054.77	<font color='navy'>They always talk about Caribbean people, and the Anansi-ism. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of it up here, where we come and in no time we have a house and whatever. And it&#39;s all because of our tricks. But I</font>	Transcription
1054.771	1061.31	<font color='navy'>think Anansi is about taking opportunity when it offers itself, and just looking around and making sure that you see it.</font>	Transcription

1062.001	1074.81	<font color='#008080'>And much industry. Anansi, I think, is part of a migrant personality, it need not be a West Indian coming to America or going to England, it could be any migrant going anywhere. And that same person</font>	Transcription
1074.841	1086.21	<font color='#008080'>at home is quite laid back. People from here come to the Caribbean just to comment on how laid back we are. And then they meet us up here and say how industrious we are. It&#39;s the same people.</font>	Transcription

1140.001	1151.37	<font color='navy'>Gran. Well, that is really harking back to the short story that is not so short about <i>Gran</i>, which is about, which is perhaps my only autobiographical piece about my grandmother.</font>	Transcription
1152.391	1163.55	<font color='navy'>And this is a woman who really, I have always had a great respect for. When her husband died she had seven children: one was nine, the oldest, and the youngest was nine months.</font>	Transcription
1164.451	1177.62	<font color='navy'>And she-- now, she was not poverty-stricken, I have to admit. There was land, there was a mill and copper, which is what they used to make sugar. But all of that stuff her husband was in charge of and</font>	Transcription
1177.621	1190.7	<font color='navy'>he just died quite suddenly. And I remember her at the mill and copper, giving orders to men so much taller and bigger than she was. And just getting out there at six o&#39;clock every morning and doing</font>	Transcription
1190.701	1191.99	<font color='navy'>what had to be done and,</font>	Transcription
1192.321	1203.87	<font color='navy'>She&#39;s established herself as a baker so she was baking, she was selling sugar where people would come to the boiling house to but by the sugar in these pans, sort of, and making sure there was enough</font>	Transcription
1203.871	1215.36	<font color='navy'>money to put all the children through school. So whenever I see myself doing something and people say, how do you manage that? I know that I&#39;m not doing much, I&#39;m doing a quarter of what she did. But</font>	Transcription
1215.361	1230.12	<font color='navy'>in a sense I am Gran. And I&#39;m not sure which bit of Alice Walker&#39;s work I had read. Why I dedicated it to her. Oh, she said, &#39;We are all grandmothers&#39;. Yes, yes, that&#39;s it. That&#39;s how that came--</font>	Transcription

1230.121	1241.82	<font color='#008080'>You once said that Gran is an excuse to &quot;big up&quot; a strong female symbol of Jamaican peasantocracy. How important do you see that still, in Jamaican society?</font>	Transcription
1242.54	1254.72	<font color='navy'><b>Velma Pollard</b></font>	Speaker
1242.541	1254.72	<font color='navy'>I see its lack, still. And I think that a lot of the people who have gone astray now have not had access to this kind of person, nor respect for this kind of person. Everybody wants to</font>	Transcription
1254.721	1267.77	<font color='navy'>get rich very quickly. My grandmother had to do lots of things so that my mother could have a profession, so that she could want me to have a profession. Everybody wants to be well off, or to get</font>	Transcription
1267.771	1273.47	<font color='navy'>where I am, and that&#39;s not being that well off, but comfortable. Everybody wants to get comfortable in one generation.</font>	Transcription
1274.791	1287.63	<font color='navy'>People long ago sacrificed, knowing that the next generation would benefit. Nobody is willing to sacrifice now. That&#39;s why we have in Jamaica, young women leaving their babies at home to go to dances.</font>	Transcription
1287.811	1297.98	<font color='navy'>Do you know how many children die by fire in my country, because their mothers went to a dance? Went to a dance, and left the children there.</font>	Transcription
1299.041	1312.3	<font color='navy'>So it&#39;s a kind of-- I think that we need to get back to saying, not that we want them to be downtrodden or anything, but we just want people to take responsibility and to know that there were people</font>	Transcription
1312.301	1313.62	<font color='navy'>who take responsibility.</font>	Transcription
1314.011	1326.1	<font color='navy'>And the word &quot;peasantocracy&quot;, I like it. Because an academic, a social scientist on the campus, spoke tongue in cheek of my sister and I said, ha, they&#39;re not poor people my dear, those are from the</font>	Transcription

1397.001	1410.44	<font color='navy'>And she had been well known in that she&#39;s written things like abandonment of children, yards in the City of Kingston. And that&#39;s how she made her name. And then she came up with this volume, which she</font>	Transcription
1410.441	1420.52	<font color='navy'>showed me in 1975. She had been dissatisfied with what her social science students had to read. There were no Caribbean models, only things out of America and England.</font>	Transcription
1420.881	1434.17	<font color='navy'>So she decided to write something about growing up in Jamaica so that her students could relate to it. What happened to it is that her students never got to it. The literary people appropriated it,</font>	Transcription
1434.351	1445.87	<font color='navy'>and it has become a Carribean classic. But she, when I reached home in 1975, she had this manuscript and I read it and I said, This is magnificent what&#39;s going on here? So I made 12 copies and sent it</font>	Transcription
1445.871	1454.21	<font color='navy'>out to some friends and had them comment on it. And Gordon Rohlehr, who is a quite famous Carribean critic was as excited as I was.</font>	Transcription
1454.961	1469.21	<font color='navy'>And he said, &quot;Well, you know, this just has to come out&quot;. He has a very slow delivery, but anyway. I was going to London for some other reason. And I took it with me on his advice to John La Rose, who</font>	Transcription
1469.211	1473.89	<font color='navy'>publishes New Beacon, who grabbed it and published it. And that&#39;s the tale.</font>	Transcription

1474.601	1486.27	<font color='navy'>The rest is history. Since then, La Rose, New Beacon has published two other novels of hers and what have you. She has continued writing and she&#39;s writing-- she also has continued</font>	Transcription
1486.271	1500.01	<font color='navy'>writing academic things. She has had four academic manuscripts already in one year. Two are out already, and two are in press. And she has a novel coming. She&#39;s a very prolific writer, so.</font>	Transcription
1500.94	1511.98	<font color='#008080'><b>Daryl Cumber Dance</b></font>	Speaker
1500.941	1511.98	<font color='#008080'>Tell me about the two of you as writers. Do you often give feedback regarding manuscripts to each other? Or does she not dare that you get your hands on another one of hers before</font>	Transcription
1511.981	1512.64	<font color='#008080'>she decides what to do with it?</font>	Transcription
1512.64	1527.4	<font color='navy'><b>Velma Pollard</b></font>	Speaker
1512.641	1527.4	<font color='navy'>No. The thing is, the answer is yes and no, because it never works quite like that. Because we have so many other things to deal with, family matters, all kinds of down to earth things.</font>	Transcription
1527.791	1541.2	<font color='navy'>But I mentioned in the foreword to one of her books, which she intended to send for you, but Ivan came, so she couldn&#39;t get from-- to me. So I didn&#39;t see her before I came, so. But she says you will</font>	Transcription
1541.201	1545.31	<font color='navy'>get a package with all of them. She&#39;ll just wait till the four come out. Four [inaudible], yes.</font>	Transcription
1545.731	1563.01	<font color='navy'>But she decided, well, one of my brothers and I decided that she should not be so poor, when she&#39;s so bright. So we thought a series of lectures and this became lectures and a meal. You go to Woodside</font>	Transcription
1563.011	1575.79	<font color='navy'>on a Sunday, you pay a certain amount of money, and you&#39;ll get a lecture and a meal. Well, not many people were interested in this kind of lecture because it was really about Jamaican history and</font>	Transcription
1575.791	1579.84	<font color='navy'>sociology, but written in such a way that the man in the street could understand it.</font>	Transcription
1580.381	1591.69	<font color='navy'>Was about 10 lectures, and she really worked very hard, preparing them and reading all this stuff. First few, maybe she had 10 people and then maybe five and then soon it was just my brother and I.</font>	Transcription
1592.051	1605.82	<font color='navy'>So, anyway, what she got out of it was she put this set of lectures together. Something about I can&#39;t remember the whole title, it ends in &#39;Consciousness&#39;, though. And one book is those 12 lectures</font>	Transcription
1605.851	1611.55	<font color='navy'>put together. So in that way, I have benefited. I mean, I just sit and listen to her in awe.</font>	Transcription
1611.791	1628.26	<font color='navy'>I don&#39;t have to read all that stuff, because she has read it. And I just read what she has produced for the man in the street, and so. Or, well, let me see how I benefit from it. I, last year I was an</font>	Transcription
1628.291	1635.4	<font color='navy'>online consultant, I think, for a literature course at Fairleigh Dickinson University.</font>	Transcription
1635.971	1647.91	<font color='navy'>So when they asked me a question that I didn&#39;t understand, you&#39;re online so you don&#39;t have to answer immediately. I would telephone her and get the absolute accurate answer. Something about, say Kamau</font>	Transcription
1647.911	1659.76	<font color='navy'>Brathwaite in the &#39;70s before I came back to Jamaica, and she would know. So I would get absolutely the right answer. And let me say in terms of an earlier question, what does it feel like to be part</font>	Transcription
1659.761	1661.29	<font color='navy'>of this community of writers?</font>	Transcription
1661.651	1675.27	<font color='navy'>What it really, how it really works is that they are accessible to me. If I want to remember a line of Walcott, say. I was writing an article on the sewing machine, which is one of my favorite</font>	Transcription

1849.831	1859.7	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m saying that those who go when-- mostly not because they were writers, but because whatever they were doing, they would make a better living abroad. Those of us who come for once a year or so a</font>	Transcription

1868.251	1877.16	<font color='NONE'>Hey Daryl, [inaudible] there&#39;s about time for one more question. And you may have even [inaudible] a follow-up [inaudible]. I was thinking, did you also ask her, since you see</font>	Transcription
1877.161	1882.56	<font color='NONE'>yourself as something else and a writer, like, where do you find the time? How do you, what&#39;s the muse? How do you--?</font>	Transcription

1882.481	1890.97	<font color='#008080'>Well, what I was thinking about asking, and you can decide what you rather-- to give you a chance. She does so many other things, the work on Rastafarianism, for example, and that</font>	Transcription

1907.761	1911.12	<font color='NONE'>Yeah. How do you how do you fit into your life, the writing, how does it happen?</font>	Transcription
1911.0	1927.98	<font color='#008080'><b>Daryl Cumber Dance</b></font>	Speaker
1911.001	1927.98	<font color='#008080'>And then you can get that into this too. Okay. Velma, as someone who&#39;s-- mother, grandmother, who&#39;s worked as an educator, a teacher, a dean, someone who is a poet, a short story</font>	Transcription
1927.981	1934.22	<font color='#008080'>writer, a novelist, a linguist, where do you find the time? And how do you fit all of these into your schedule?</font>	Transcription
1934.22	1946.79	<font color='navy'><b>Velma Pollard</b></font>	Speaker
1934.221	1946.79	<font color='navy'>Now, when you put it like that it sounds like a lot of things. And almost as if, really, how can I fit it in. But if I were a carpenter, I would still have had to be making things. In</font>	Transcription
1946.791	1963.83	<font color='navy'>other words, the career bit is just there. And I appreciate the fact that I write, because when I-- if I get home, and I&#39;m really fed up with all those meetings, and all the rest of it, I always have</font>	Transcription
1963.831	1966.32	<font color='navy'>something on a yellow pad that needs typing out.</font>	Transcription
1967.281	1978.56	<font color='navy'>Something that has not been neated up before. So I usually just go to the yellow pad, and now that there is a computer, before that it was a typewriter, and try to type out something neat. And I think</font>	Transcription
1978.561	1984.74	<font color='navy'>that that really calms me. And it&#39;s a haven to me to move into my creative self.</font>	Transcription
1985.461	1998.78	<font color='navy'>And I have written poetry and short fiction a lot. I only wrote the novel, the year I got sabbatical. Before the year began, I had a summer, in a workshop, the University of Miami, and I started the</font>	Transcription
1998.781	2005.47	<font color='navy'>novel and finished it during the year. I&#39;ve never had that kind of time again. And so I have not written another novel.</font>	Transcription
2005.951	2017.71	<font color='navy'>But, and I&#39;ve been very-- when I was dean, I was very resentful. I&#39;m always resentful of administration because I hate it. And because I hate it, I have to try to do it well. And so it takes up all my</font>	Transcription
2017.711	2031.96	<font color='navy'>time. And I, so I started writing something called &quot;In Spite of Miss Dean&quot;, when I was dean to show that in those four years or three years, I still-- so I wrote a set of vignettes, you may call them</font>	Transcription
2031.991	2036.67	<font color='navy'>because they had to be short. The time was so small. &quot;In Spite of Miss Dean&quot;.</font>	Transcription
2036.661	2048.45	<font color='navy'>Well, poetry. I write more poetry than prose, I think, because poetry can keep on going on in your head while you are working while you are washing while you are cooking. The poetry goes on, and then</font>	Transcription
2048.451	2059.07	<font color='navy'>you get a little minute, you scribble it down and leave it. And then you get another minute and you revise it, so I always have poems being revised. I have a folder that every-- whenever I have a</font>	Transcription
2059.071	2071.49	<font color='navy'>minute I just pick up that folder. So that I may have written a poem six months ago, and I haven&#39;t seen it for a while until I have a chance when I pick up the folder that&#39;s on top, I just revise all</font>	Transcription
2071.491	2073.14	<font color='navy'>of them. So one,</font>	Transcription
2073.171	2074.49	<font color='navy'>So you may be working on five or six at a time?</font>	Transcription
2074.491	2085.65	<font color='navy'>So one-- Poems, right. So and they&#39;re like 10 thick as I do the revised versions. So when people tell me, &#39;Oh, I just scribbled a poem, do you want to hear it&#39;? I say no. I don&#39;t want to hear it. I</font>	Transcription
2085.651	2093.69	<font color='navy'>don&#39;t want to hear anything you just scribbled. When I write down something I have to go over it so many times that I don&#39;t want to hear anything you-- So the business of fitting in is that its not</font>	Transcription
2093.691	2097.95	<font color='navy'>that the time is there. As I say I always have the paper and I write the stuff.</font>	Transcription
2098.251	2114.57	<font color='navy'>Now, the business of <i>Dread Talk</i>. I came home in 1975. I had been interested in Rasta before, but I had not lived in Jamaica in my post-University state. And I started going to meetings and</font>	Transcription
2114.601	2117.42	<font color='navy'>Rasta was all around me and I am in linguistics.</font>	Transcription
2117.751	2132.51	<font color='navy'>And I discovered that the academic world outside was coming to the Caribbean, and writing long papers on very small things, things that I wouldn&#39;t have thought were worthy of writing about. So I said,</font>	Transcription
2132.541	2146.01	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m gonna write about dread talk. Whereby-- and I mean, I&#39;ve just kept on writing about it. Now I&#39;m, the last thing I wrote about was, it&#39;s a collaborative work myself and our Cuban linguist about</font>	Transcription
