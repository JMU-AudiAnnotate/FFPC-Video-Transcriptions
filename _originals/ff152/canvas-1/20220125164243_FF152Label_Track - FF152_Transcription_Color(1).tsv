10.718988	19.035444	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Elizabeth Alexander. E-l-i-z-a-b-e-t-h, A-l-e-x-a-n-d-e-r.</font>	Transcription
20.575529	33.389032	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>All right. Wow. Elizabeth, I wanted to start out by asking you a question that it seems to me your work really bears to mind. And it's about the relationship between your work and the African diaspora,</font>	Transcription
33.389032	42.383125	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>particularly one of the things that I noticed about your work is that you really kind of both embrace ideas about race, but also question the boundaries of it.</font>	Transcription
42.383125	66.377641	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>If you think about 'West Indian Primer', where you're talking about both your Jamaican ancestry and then how it moves beyond that, or if you think about your poem for Nelson Mandela, where you start talking about, you know, 'I am a black daughter', but in a way that connects to the South African president, and in an interesting way. Could you talk about the relationship between your work and a diasporic context? </font>	Transcription, Question
66.624055	93.729542	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Well, that reading that you just gave of that line, 'I am a black daughter', that break-- It seems to me, and I'm just now thinking about this, echoes Gwendolyn Brooks' great poem where she talks about 'I am a Black', 'I am one of the Blacks', where she feels that to be called merely African American is limiting and almost in a way euphemistic. That it skips over an understanding of how we are all connected to each other, across the globe.</font>	Transcription
93.729542	121.112244	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Sometimes in our actual histories, in the case of the Jamaican grandfather there's a lot of personal history in my poems as you know, or in newer poems. My husband is from Eritrea, so now I have a whole East African connection going on. But in a way, I think what we learn from those real histories is how complicated and sometimes nostalgic and sometimes full of fantasy, the idea of Africa is for us.</font>	Transcription
121.112244	133.80254	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, and I think that as African Americans, we have always tried to connect to that idea, because so much has been cut off and interrupted. But at the same time, it's a fantasy,</font>	Transcription
133.80254	151.66752	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>though I think it is a heartfelt and beautiful fantasy that has led many of us, myself included, to reading and learning and reaching out and exploration and trying to theorize in very personal terms: What does it mean to be African people in this diaspora all across the world?</font>	Transcription
151.66752	172.581867	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I think also one of the beautiful realities of the United States, and for me of growing up in Washington, DC, is that you met Black people from all over the world. And that's something I touch on as well, something that was very important to my own African American grandmother growing up in Washington, DC.</font>	Transcription
172.581867	186.257818	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>She would go and sit on the steps of embassies, because it let her imagine the world. And so that was a fortunate thing to grow up with: just that sense that we are, we are a multi-people.</font>	Transcription
186.257818	212.316047	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>It's-- I love hearing you talk about that. Because in that poem that, where you actually invoke your grandmother sitting on the steps of embassy row, you have the line where you talk about what is a princess like in 'Feminist Poem Number One', what is, uh, what your grandmother would call and say to her-- her international friends, I am an American Negro, right, and what is an American Negro princess? And so in some ways, I think that hearing you talk about that--</font>	Transcription
212.316047	232.829972	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>and then in that same poem you actually refer to your husband and then talk about, you know, as an Abyssinian. And so its interesting how, within the context of one poem, both in terms of gender relationships, in terms of how that intersects our ideas about race and our ideas about kind of connections to Africa, that all gets kind of wrapped up into that,</font>	Transcription
232.829972	251.156978	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>as well as class, right? Because anytime you kind of invoke these ideas about the princesses, it's the sense of the grandmother who wants to travel to see the world and you have traveled to see the world, right. Within the context of the line, for the poem the husband that takes you to the airport for a passport, which means of course that you're--</font>	Transcription
250.479341	252.204235	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Going somewhere.</font>	Transcription
251.156978	276.968794	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>You're going somewhere, right, and eventually coming back. And so I think that's really a useful way to think about it. But even domestically, I find that your work covers so many different kinds of Black artists and authors and photographers and athletes from Mohammed Ali to James Van Der Zee to Paul Robeson to Romero Bearden,</font>	Transcription
276.968794	303.350441	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>and I'm wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit about, about myth, right, and Black mythic figures and major historical figures that seem to occur in your work. And I note that my list-- at this moment I'm using Black male figures because we started, um I moved in a bit of a different direction, but even your, in, Nat Turner poem. Right? So if, would you comment on that?</font>	Transcription, Question
302.503394	333.397489	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Well yeah, I mean, I think our history, our culture is so rich, it's so under explored, it's so distortedly imagined, that it just has always seemed to me that that is an infinite mother lode for poetry. I think in some ways, what that speaks to biographically is that I spent a lot of time in school and in universities, although when I think about the reading, that gave me my information, very often, it was actually autodidactic study,</font>	Transcription
333.397489	356.37555	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>it was not always what I was learning in school. But nonetheless, that context, that idea of reading to know, reading as experience that is deeply, deeply felt, and taken in reading as being-- and learning, as somehow on a, an equivalent plane to the things that you know from living your life without books.</font>	Transcription
356.37555	385.575551	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, to those of us for whom culture is that important, I think it's important to assert that it's lived life, it's real experience. So calling all of that in, being a scholar of African American culture, you know, it's what I teach, it's what I've been thinking about for a long time, I find that poems are a great place to work with that. That said, this whole idea of myth, you know, I, the word Abyssinian,</font>	Transcription
382.402977	383.203821	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes.</font>	Transcription
384.959518	386.961628	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Right, of course it is! Exactly.</font>	Transcription
385.575551	389.287155	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>That's not what you call people today, from Eritrea.</font>	Transcription
387.154138	391.058252	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>No, not at all! Of course, of course, I do know that, so.</font>	Transcription
389.602872	408.476608	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So you know, that whole, you know that to me-- yeah, I think where did it come from? That was a magical word. One of those sort of elsewhere words, one of those elsewhere Black people words, that has appealed to me from God knows what sources from as long as I can remember. </font>	Transcription
408.476608	437.32239	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes, yes. Thank you so much. Well, it's interesting hearing you talk about kind of-- in that context, you being a scholar of African American culture, and a teacher in points being the space where you're able to kind of explore this mother lode, because I'd actually like to talk a little bit about your newest work, 'The Black Interior'. And one of the things, you know, first off that is different, right, is that it's a collection of essays obviously, unlike your previous three books before that.</font>	Transcription
437.32239	461.886738	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>And it strikes me that it is at once both scholarly, but also attempting to speak to a larger community that is not just dealing with issues of books, right, we have essays in there, one on Julia Cooper, of course, so that's definitely in the kind of intellectual or readerly tradition. But you have an essay on Denzel Washington, right? You have an essay on Rodney King. You have an essay, my goodness on jet, right?</font>	Transcription
461.886738	495.506782	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>'Notes Toward a Notion of Race-Pride'. And so there's a way in which I really see your work as working with both, kind of, the African American scholarly tradition in terms of literary culture, but also and I think in important ways, more broadly, popular culture, right, in ways that I think, are useful for students, right? Because I know that, that you also teach. Could you talk about kind of the role that you see 'Black Interior' playing in the trajectory of your work as a writer? And--</font>	Transcription, Question
495.506782	508.351087	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yeah. Well, I mean, I think one of the things, you know, when you're taught close reading as a method in graduate study and undergraduate study English classes, it should be applicable to anything that constitutes a text.</font>	Transcription
508.073871	508.96712	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes.</font>	Transcription
508.96712	531.39075	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So there was actually a wonderful article by Stanley Fish, your UIC colleague, at, in the New York Times where he was-- had his students do close readings of a speech by Bush, a speech by Kerry. And he talked about repetition, assonance, all the, the-- what we think of as poetic devices of how people do or don't get their message across.</font>	Transcription
531.39075	561.946027	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>How language works on us. So I think those tools, we should be able to turn them anyplace. And while I do think that there are all kinds of things that you can say about, you know, 'poetry is not jet magazine'. But, at the same time, how does our culture manifest itself? How does it live in people who don't necessarily call themselves professional artists? And how do a lot of the issues that are of importance in our poetry and in our popular culture cross back and forth.</font>	Transcription
561.946027	589.605944	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I'm very interested in that. The book, as you know, was a long time coming, and in many ways that long time is a testimony to the challenges of finding a prose voice. You know, when an academic, a more conventionally academic voice didn't feel like a jacket that fit. And at the same time, I wanted to bring in what I know as an artist, how I look at the world as an artist,</font>	Transcription
589.605944	606.577675	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>and I wanted to operate in a tradition of belles lettres that is exemplified by people like June Jordan, who's a very, very important figure to me, and who's an incredibly important essayist, and I believe, has published more essays than any Black woman in history.</font>	Transcription
606.577675	607.101304	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes</font>	Transcription
607.101304	609.442232	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I'm pretty sure that that's true. </font>	Transcription
609.442232	610.212274	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes.</font>	Transcription
610.212274	625.613119	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And so what does it mean to, in the way that I love, to listen to a smart person with a wide field of reference, hold forth. Felicitously. I wanted to be that person in writing.</font>	Transcription
625.613119	660.326623	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And I think that actually also within Blackness, we, we have so many great raconteurs, we have so many oral geniuses who can hold forth, in a way that is just amazing. And so I think that somehow also those patterns of address and argument were somehow underneath and in there as well. But finding that voice was challenging. And now that the book is out there, you know, my, my wish and my hope is that it find its readers. And I think that's a slow process too. </font>	Transcription
660.326623	662.513543	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</font>	Transcription
661.466286	662.944767	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yeah, but that's okay.</font>	Transcription
662.944767	682.565443	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Right. Well, I-- well in, within the context of the readership or audience of 'Black Interior', I think different people will come to the book with different needs and expectations. And so the nice thing about kind of the aspect of it being a work that looks at different aspects of Black culture in very diverse ways.</font>	Transcription
682.565443	699.783588	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>And also, I think, using a language that is not an academic straightjacket, you know, in terms of, as a scholar of African American literature, the tradition, in terms of the scholarly tradition, there's certain expectations about language and kind of heightened language, or what is recognized or thought of as theoretical language.</font>	Transcription
699.783588	719.773885	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>And yet, I find in 'The Black Interior', if you think, for example of your essay on Michael Harper, who I know has been an influence on you, that there is a way in which you, you use insightful close readings, right, of some of his, of his poems from 'Dear John, Dear Coltrane', and poems, on Bessie Smith, for example,</font>	Transcription
719.773885	742.012705	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>but not terminology, that someone who has not taken, you know, American poetry 101 at Yale University would not be able to understand. And I think that's really important terms of thinking about kind of the artist and her relationship to community, right, and to audience in really, really useful ways.</font>	Transcription
741.365869	767.855322	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And I think also there's something interesting, I haven't, I'm just thinking of it this very moment, but something interesting about hierarchy and apprenticeship, in the ways that people are quoted, other experts and colleagues are quoted in the essays. But my dad read some of them in an earlier phase, he said, Why do you have to quote 10 people to say what you're trying to say? Just say what you're trying to say, and-- you're you're a grown up. </font>	Transcription
767.732115	768.286546	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Right</font>	Transcription
768.286546	801.028742	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Say what you're trying to say. But of course, you know, in, in academic writing, you have to quote 10 other people, who said what you said first, in order to say what you have to say. And yet I do think that there is something within our oral communities about earning the right to speak, and about moving through ancestral wisdom and knowledge in order to have your moment to hold forth. So I think that there are different ways of sort of moving through those channels, to your moment in the sun.</font>	Transcription
801.028742	816.244777	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that, because when you think about the kind of oral communities or oral culture in the way that it's associated with Black culture as an oral culture. Though, of course, in terms of scholarship, people are questioning that as a too easy identification.</font>	Transcription
816.244777	838.391192	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>But one thing I noticed in your poetry is that, and you mentioned this at a conference at Yale a few years ago, where you're talking about kind of giving voice to Black female figures within our history, that you seem to not be able to find in the historical record, a record of their voice, right? And so,</font>	Transcription
838.391192	865.034653	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>you have the poem 'Yolande Speaks' right, in which you think about all the literature about Dubois, and even though you know, Gerald Horne has done a wonderful biography of Shirley Dubois, that Dubois' daughter, right, his only daughter, we don't hear her voice as much in the historical record. And there's a there's a way in which, you know, poems such as that where you have her not only have a voice but a perspective, right?</font>	Transcription
865.034653	896.421575	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>She's like: 'I've laughed/ at my father's gloves// and spats' which both humanizes him but also gives her kind of a sense of distance from him to kind of have a perspective on, on him.  Or your, your first book of poetry, 'The Venus Hottentot', which, which opens with, you know-- although it opens with Cuvier by the time we get to Saartjie Bartman's voice, right, You have her being insistently multilingual, right? I speak English, I speak French, I speak Dutch and I even speak 'languages Monsieur Cuvier/ will never know have names'.</font>	Transcription
896.421575	911.760816	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>There's a way in which I think that your work really does speak to the need for an awareness of this kind of orality as an aspect of Black culture without simplifying it.</font>	Transcription
911.760816	935.693729	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Mm hmm. Yes. And I think also with that moment in Venus Hottentot, the idea that we always are trying-- we always know more than we manifest. And that really interests me, both with myself, in my own continual-- I think it's a lifelong process of coming to voice, you know. You get there, okay, but then you keep moving forward,</font>	Transcription
935.693729	951.464194	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>and really trying to process and distill all the knowledge and all the wisdom. But we always know more than we manifest. And she is a great exemplar of that. And I think that's a very interesting secret weapon.</font>	Transcription
951.464194	955.437612	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes, yes. Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
952.757865	954.066937	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>That we need to think about.</font>	Transcription
955.437612	963.630862	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Absolutely. I wanna actually shift to talk about the visuals, [inaudible] by talking about the oral. And I brought with me, my beloved copies of,</font>	Transcription
962.737613	964.092887	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>The babies.</font>	Transcription
963.707866	987.255758	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>The babies! I'm sure they're your babies, but my copies of them. My duplicates, and one thing that really strikes me is your-- the, and I don't know what degree of control you have over this, whether it's your editors' choices, or whether you're involved in the selection of this, but the covers of your books, right, and the beautiful artwork that has-- and Black artwork, you know, in particular--</font>	Transcription
987.255758	999.915252	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>that has been a part of the process of your books. And I wondered if you could talk, um, a bit about each one. And I'm missing, I didn't bring with me, it's back in my office, the original, right, copy of The Venus Hott--</font>	Transcription
991.567994	993.693311	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yes, absolutely</font>	Transcription
998.621581	999.915252	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>But we can talk about that.</font>	Transcription
999.915252	1032.626647	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>But if we could, I thought it would be really useful. Because so much of your work-- Although I've made that kind of oral comment, there's also a way in which you have so many poems that really deal with the visual image, right, and the concrete visual image, with visual artists, Bearden, Monet and so forth. The photographers. But, but there's a way in which I sense your work, and certainly in essays in 'The Black Interior', where you talk about how do Blacks relate to kind of the distortion of images of ourselves,</font>	Transcription
1032.626647	1044.485297	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>and culture and-- without feeling the imperative to just only create positive images. So if you could just talk about your book covers and visuality in general, I'd appreciate it.</font>	Transcription
1038.663778	1039.80344	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>That's right.</font>	Transcription
1044.238884	1060.995003	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Well, I've been very aggressive about controlling that. And with the first cover of 'The Venus Hottentot', that was University of Virginia Press, many many years ago. And the first cover that was-- I thought, let's see what they come up with.</font>	Transcription
1060.995003	1085.266734	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>As much as art is so important to me and as much as beautiful books are important to me. And what they came up with was a baby aspirin colored cover with scallop shells alluding as best I could see to Venus de Milo rising up out of the sea. And I thought, okay, so if after reading that poem, that is the title poem of that book, all-- it sort of proves the thesis. </font>	Transcription
1084.927916	1085.266734	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes.</font>	Transcription
1085.266734	1105.719056	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, and what you see and what you imagine, is Venus de Milo coming out of the sea, and that the color in which you cast these poems is baby aspirin, pinky-peach. I got to take control of this. We, you can't sort of negotiate with that. You can't work with that. That's too far out.</font>	Transcription
1105.719056	1106.5199	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>That's so true.</font>	Transcription
1106.5199	1132.516526	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So the the painting that I chose was a painting by Charles Alston, who's my great uncle, my mother's uncle, and it's called 'ballet dancer', and it's a picture of a Black woman-- too bad the picture couldn't have been in color because you can see it's sort of yellows and teals. She looks a bit whiter colored than she actually is in the reproduction, but she has a kind of physical composure.</font>	Transcription
1132.516526	1152.876443	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>That seemed to me to be very important as that relates to The Venus Hottentot. What does it mean to be that woman who's-- she's in leotards, her body is outlined and exposed, but yet, even though you are being watched, your inner life is your own. That was what I thought was in that implacable face in that, in that painting.</font>	Transcription
1152.876443	1178.534251	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And so ever after, you know I just, it was with 'Body of Life' which is Tia Chucha press, they were very excited to have me find my own cover, and this is by a great painter, who's a friend of mine, Kerry James Marshall. And there's a lot of romantic dynamics in this book and this painting is called 'Could This be Love'. And just a fabulous painting with so many small details that you can just about make up:</font>	Transcription
1178.534251	1208.165476	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>the calendar stained with her menstrual blood, the sculpture, the Africanesque sculpture in the background echoing her form. All that Kerry James Marshall does with the black black that is not the color of anyone, but is a color of sort of mythos in a way. The songs in the background, he's saying, 'What a woman, what a woman, what a woman'. So there's just a lot you know, the, the Vodoun heart in there.</font>	Transcription
1208.165476	1231.174338	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So much going on, a very talky painting in a way that I think, communicates nicely with the paintings inside. Then in 'Antebellum Dream Book' again, the first cover that was given to me-- I said again, I'm at a new press, a press that I love, let me see what they do. And it was a picture of, you know I said it looked like the cover to Sounder.</font>	Transcription

1231.759571	1264.19375	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>There's a Black girl on a porch, screen door, basket of produce. And I said, so how do you read that book and make that cover? Again, it speaks to me to-- how are they seeing us? How, with, with the book in-- and so I said, can't work with this, we got to just start all over again. And this painting is Bob Thompson's 'The Garden of Music', which I just adore. And because there are dream poems in the book, I felt that there was a very dreamlike quality, a surreal quality to these wonderful purple people.</font>	Transcription
1242.786575	1244.480668	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes, absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1264.19375	1282.42835	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And, you know, that, that it was a dreamscape in a way that I thought worked with the books, the poems inside. And then with Black Interior, we've spoken at the conference, Sonia Sanchez mentioned, the great Elizabeth Catlett. And this image is called 'The Black Woman Speaks'</font>	Transcription
1282.089531	1283.290797	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>So appropriate.</font>	Transcription
1283.290797	1305.344807	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, and there it is. And as I talk about in the book, what you can't see on the picture, on the side, there is a sort of a spiral that's inscribed on her temple, if you were to have a side view. And you know, the spiral is a symbol of infinity, and it seems to me that that it also suggests, it almost-- as though it's a drawing of what's inside the Black woman's head.</font>	Transcription
1305.344807	1307.254512	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Yes, yes</font>	Transcription
1305.683626	1335.46886	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>An infinite, infinite spiral. And Catlett made this work in about 1970, when she herself was a very, very mature artist, mother of grown children. Which connects with my conversation of Gwendolyn Brooks, at the same point more or less in her life. A very senior woman, a very acclaimed artist, nonetheless subject to change, responsive to the times.</font>	Transcription
1335.46886	1337.871392	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Willing to evolve.</font>	Transcription
1337.255358	1362.143123	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Willing to evolve. And I think that, that was-- in addition to just that it's, it's a ravishing piece of work, it's a beautiful, beautiful sculpture. And it's it's also a nice picture of a sculpture, which is hard to do sometimes. But to me, you know, I'm interested in artists' careers over time, you know, want to be in it for the long haul. And so and that's why it's so fortunate to be here with people like Sonia and Lucille.</font>	Transcription
1362.143123	1367.132997	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Because you see that long, tradition. Long tradition.</font>	Transcription
1364.484051	1372.708103	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Long, and you know, and that these are people who have also-- I have small children, these are people who have raised children, who have made a life in the arts.</font>	Transcription
1370.921605	1384.412745	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>And mothers, and wives, and partners and all of these things and still been artists, and scholars, and in so many ways and theorists of Black culture, right. And so. Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1377.205149	1377.851985	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yes.</font>	Transcription
1381.671394	1389.61823	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yes, yes, yes. And so that's, those are the women that give me power, you know.</font>	Transcription
1389.833842	1403.756206	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Me as well. I can definitely identify with that. Thank you so much for that. I want to ask a more just simply basic question, since I've been-- How do you know when you are ready to start or finish a poem?</font>	Transcription, Question
1403.756206	1430.892494	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Ooh. Well at this conference I have felt really ready to start a lot of poems. I think that being around poetry and being around people who make poetry makes new poems happen, you know. It's like this incredible, biodynamic thing that, that happens, you just sort of-- you take a word, you take a line, you take a sort of a modal imprint, and the poems are ready to come.</font>	Transcription
1430.892494	1444.322031	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And then for me, as for all of us, there's always the question of time, and where to find-- you know, I love that Lucille Clifton, when she was talking about what it was to have four children in diapers at the same time. And she said to the audience, you think you're busy?</font>	Transcription
1444.322031	1446.84777	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Right. Right. Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1445.738909	1475.308531	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And she has spoken about actually how the ideal circumstances for her to write poetry became domestic chaos.  Because that's what it was. You know, that if you know, she says, one-- you're at the kitchen table, and one child's got the measles and the other child's got the homework and that everything is going on. Nonetheless, you somehow make that space. And I am working to do that as I think whether or not we have children we're always, in the midst of our lives, we all have to make a living. No poet is supporting him or herself solely by the word.</font>	Transcription
1475.308531	1500.44271	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So you're trying to make that bubble, or develop the habit that says, at least in my bag, the notebook is always there. Although, because driving ends up sometimes to be the only free time there is. Can't quite write the things down as well, you know, on the road, as well as you would like to. So it's that feeling though, which I'm having now which I'm having after this conference of being full up.</font>	Transcription
1500.44271	1526.008112	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And then you know, then there's process, process, process. But then the ready to be done with it is a tricky thing as well. I was speaking with some students recently about how you sort of go as far as you can, and then you leave it and come back to it after it's had time to sit. And then you can more clearly see, okay, was I just tired? Was I just out of ideas? Or maybe this really is done.</font>	Transcription
1526.008112	1541.347354	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Or maybe now I can see what the final tweak is. And I have poems that have remained in folders for years and years and years and years, snippets for years, that then you find, okay, this is how I can use this. This is how I can complete this.</font>	Transcription
1542.641024	1544.365919	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Do you revise your work alot?</font>	Transcription, Question
1544.365919	1564.941448	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, hopefully, what happens when you get lucky, is that there's a rush in the beginning, that at least gets a large chunk sketched out. Though, that then also will be revised and revised and revised. But I like when there's enough-- that mysterious enoughness to put the poem over the cliff.</font>	Transcription
1564.941448	1566.419929	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1565.988705	1578.740605	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I can feel when I'm like, uhh, I'm not at the edge of the cliff. So I'm not there. And sometimes that stuff gets wasted or lost. But you know, one must be Zen about these things. You know, nothing is wasted.</font>	Transcription
1578.740605	1601.164235	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Nothing, nothing, nothing. And do you have a favorite poem? Is there a poem of yours that you just-- I know, for example, I've memorized a number of your poems but this is as someone who's not-- is coming to it from a different perspective. And I'm just curious if, if you've memorized some of yours, do you have any poems that you just go like, I love this? Or is it each new poem is the favorite, or--?</font>	Transcription, Question
1601.164235	1627.653688	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yeah, yeah. There are some that I'm extra proud of mostly because of the work. You know, 'The Venus Hottentot', I worked very, very hard on it, to keep those two voices distinct and consistent, and to really take myself into a very, very other world of imagination. So I was proud of it as work. In this new collection, I have a really long, a 25 page poem on the Amistad. </font>	Transcription
1627.653688	1646.997149	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I've been working on it for years. I've done a ton of research. You know, I'm proud of it, because it was hard, good work. And I tried to be meticulous and faithful. I mean, you know, you always are, but maybe it's the-- it's easier to be proud of the sort of bigger projects in a sense.</font>	Transcription
1646.997149	1671.946518	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>But I think also moments in poems where I know I have been true, when I could have been cute? Meaning, just clever or, you know, a fancy word but maybe not the right word, or you know, a wonderful music, but only for its own sake, and not furthering anything in the poem.</font>	Transcription
1671.946518	1704.07268	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, moments where I have avoided cuteness or showiness, which has been ingrained in me as a modus operandi from a very early age. You know, my grandmother, if anyone said, you know, to any child in her world, you know, oh, you know, what a pretty little girl. 'And she is a very nice child'. You know, 'and she is a very bright girl. And she's a very kind girl'. That was-- and you know, with such a voice that said, you know, so don't even try. </font>	Transcription
1702.409389	1709.401372	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>You can't even try to count on the cute. Don't count on the cute. Right, right.</font>	Transcription
1705.828376	1723.292934	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Don't even puff up. Don't even puff up, you know, because it's the values of what make you a good human being. That that's what's important. So I think that as-- that's an, actually a very useful poetic value as well too. Just because you can doesn't mean you always should.</font>	Transcription
1723.292934	1743.252429	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>And so that you see that translation between them. Well, I actually have a poem that I'd like to hear you talk about, and it appeared in The New Yorker. That is, well, I have a number of favorite things, poems, on your corpus. But it's certainly one that I would love to hear you talk about. And it's 'When'.</font>	Transcription
1743.252429	1767.616566	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yes, well that, just this morning at the conference, Honor??e Jeffers gave a great paper about blues, sort of a manifesto on blues poetics. And she was talking about different elements that make a contemporary blues poem. Because we're at a fascinating moment, you know, we're not Langston, we're not Sterling. We're not inventing the form of the blues poem in the middle of that music being widely distributed in record form.</font>	Transcription
1767.616566	1784.773107	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>It's incredible when you read those Hughes and Van Vechten letters, when they're sending blues lyrics back and forth. Because as, you know, it's one thing to go and the dishwasher on the ship is singing the blues. But you know, for for records to be available. I mean, these are letters in the '20s.</font>	Transcription
1784.773107	1785.573951	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1785.573951	1814.650746	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So it's new so I mean, wow, it-- hats off to Langston and then to Sterling Brown for making the form in poetry, literary form that nonetheless comes out of the blues. But we're in a different moment. And what is the blues today and how is the blues aesthetic an element of African American culture that comes out in all sorts of different ways that aren't necessarily immediately identifiable as what Murray would call the blues as such, right?</font>	Transcription
1814.650746	1844.497583	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So she was talking about the blues, and she said that 'When' was a poem that she taught as a blues poem? And I said, Well, isn't that interesting? It's a sonnet. And to me, it was a sonnet in the mode of the Hayden sonnets, specifically 'Those Winter Sundays' in 'Frederick Douglass', which I think redefine what a sonnet can be. And then where my thinking took me, and I thought, well, what makes 'Those Winter Sundays', such a great Hayden sonnet is that the blues cracked open the sonnet form.</font>	Transcription
1844.497583	1845.298427	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1845.298427	1850.442309	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>And literally, the blues cracks open that poem. You know, 'What did I know, what did I know?'</font>	Transcription
1850.442309	1853.18366	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>'Of love's austere and lonely offices?' Right?</font>	Transcription
1853.18366	1873.759189	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I mean, you know, What did I know? You can just hear it spoken like that. So that reanimated the form. And I think it got at a way of talking-- you know, if the blue note is the space between the black and the white keys, I think that the blue note is a space of nuance, that is what I'm trying to explore in that poem.</font>	Transcription
1873.759189	1889.406447	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>It's the nuance that is very specific about talking about these particular Black men, though it begins with a sweeping sort of magical generality. 'In the early 1980s, the black men/ were divine', you know, all of them, the Black men.</font>	Transcription
1889.406447	1893.164253	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Could you read that? Would you be willing to read it? Now, would you all mind?</font>	Transcription
1891.716574	1893.164253	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Yeah, sure. Should I?</font>	Transcription
1893.164253	1895.751595	Yeah, I'm just-- are you gonna read it later today?	Transcription
1894.889148	1897.230076	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I was gonna read it later today. Oh, so we don't need to.</font>	Transcription
1895.751595	1898.40054	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Oh, so then you don't need her to read it. Oh, I'm sorry.</font>	Transcription
1897.230076	1911.383452	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Um, but so, you know, there's that sort of sweeping beginning and then all of these particulars about these amazing Black men. You know, their style, their brilliance, their fabulosities, you know they--</font>	Transcription
1899.571004	1901.403705	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Okay then, yeah.</font>	Transcription
1910.79822	1913.647377	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>They're reading, they all quote Fanon. Right.</font>	Transcription
1911.383452	1935.300965	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>That's right, I mean, you know, who are these men? And these were, these were-- I'm thinking specifically of a few men in the poem, particularly the poet Melvin Dixon. Who was so important to me, who died of AIDS, who, you know, to imagine him at this conference. And the likes of him, the likes of Essex Hemphill.</font>	Transcription
1935.300965	1954.089995	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, this is such a ghosty conference. And that was made visible to us last night, when we saw the people who have passed, and thinking, you know, about a June Jordan-- you know, all of the not here, not here, not here, not here. But Melvin was important to me also, because he was a real man of letters.</font>	Transcription
1954.089995	1984.244849	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I met him when he was on a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale when I was an undergraduate. He had already lived abroad, he had lived in Africa and France. That was just too fabulous for me, it was like the, you know, it was just very cool. And that he had translated, Senghor's work, he had translated criticism, was a poet, was a fiction writer, and didn't have any issues. You know, he said, if anyone has an issue with my working in these different modalities, that's their problem.</font>	Transcription
1984.244849	2014.861729	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>You know, had his PhD, but just reconciled it all. And he was a very, very, very important model to me and was a kind, kind, big brother. In-- to me, he really, really was. Which is part of why I was so proud to to edit and bring out his last collection, 'Love's Instruments', a very great book. Yeah, that I'm happy is available. So he was-- anyway, he and others were behind that poem.</font>	Transcription
2015.477763	2016.987046	We have time for one more.	Transcription
2016.771434	2018.496328	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Okay, so this is the Regen--</font>	Transcription
2016.771434	2018.249915	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Okay</font>	Transcription
2017.603079	2019.543586	A short question and a short answer.	Transcription
2019.543586	2044.369748	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Okay so the short question that-- So the Chris question is the, um, well you're editing me so I can just say this, it's The Regenerating the Black Poetic Tradition question. You talked about Dixon being a big brother to you, and being so kind and generous, and so forth. And I certainly know, the younger generation of African American writers and poets, particularly, have all spoken of you so highly as a mentor,</font>	Transcription
2019.543586	2021.145274	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Okay. We'll be Chris.</font>	Transcription
2044.369748	2070.859201	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>and as someone who has not only influenced them, but pushed them both in terms of the craft and the crafting of their verse. I believe it's Kevin Young, who in the anthology 'Giant Steps' says that, you know, you start that-- you're the first in that anthology by accident of your last name, but in fact, he says it's most appropriate because you really are seen as at the forefront, right of this generation of writers born from 1960 forward</font>	Transcription
2070.859201	2088.754983	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>in that you've worked in so many genres, like Melvin Dixon, who you've spoken about, in certain ways. Could you talk just briefly about what Black poetic tradition means to you, and how you see yourself fitting within that? </font>	Transcription, Question
2088.754983	2116.907727	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>Well I, almost nothing makes me happier than those people recognizing, because I love them. And I can't even believe, you know, Kevin Young was in college and came to one of my poetry readings. And now I mean then he was a peer but now he's a different kind of peer. I mean, all of those people are on their second and third-- well you know, Honorée Jeffers, Van Jordan, Terrence Hayes, Natasha Tretheway.</font>	Transcription
2116.907727	2118.2322	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Major Jackson.</font>	Transcription
2117.893381	2134.618698	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>I mean Major Jackson, it's, it's an incredible, incredible moment. It really, really is. And I think that we are getting, never enough, but more of the institutional support that helps make our work visible. And that's really, really important.</font>	Transcription
2134.618698	2166.683257	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>More of our books are available in more places. That's really important. Because, you know, Third World Press can't do everything. Broadside Press can't do everything. And these presses that have excluded us need to just join the-- join the new century, you know, if they missed the last century. And that's beginning to happen, people are teaching that makes a big difference. People are distinct from each other, people are having their arguments, and that's important too.</font>	Transcription
2166.683257	2170.00984	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>Absolutely the disagreement. I agree, and I-- </font>	Transcription
2168.623764	2178.819123	<font color=&#34;teal&#34;>So it's, it's an amazing amazing time I think and we're lucky to also have our elders with us to be able to look back and wonder.</font>	Transcription
2178.819123	2182.299714	<font color=&#34;#008080&#34;>And we're lucky to have you. We really are. Thank you.</font>	Transcription

2184.671444	2192.587478	Don't move. Now I just want you looking at the camera, this is the TV tech stuff. Talk to each other about anything just not at the same time I'm just getting cutaways and then I'm gonna [inaudible].	Transcription
