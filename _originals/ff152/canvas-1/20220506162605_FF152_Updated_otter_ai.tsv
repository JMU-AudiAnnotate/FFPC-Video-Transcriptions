17.001	31.97	<font color='#008080'>All right. Wow. Elizabeth, I wanted to start out by asking you a question that it seems to me your work really bears to mind. And it&#39;s about the relationship between your work and</font>	Transcription
31.971	33.2	<font color='#008080'>the African diaspora,</font>	Transcription
33.231	42.32	<font color='#008080'>particularly one of the things that I noticed about your work is that you really kind of both embrace ideas about race, but also question the boundaries of it.</font>	Transcription
42.001	52.32	<font color='#008080'>If you think about &quot;West Indian Primer,&quot; where you&#39;re talking about both your Jamaican ancestry and then how it moves beyond that, or if you think about your poem for Nelson Mandela, where you start</font>	Transcription
52.321	64.95	<font color='#008080'>talking about, you know, &quot;I am a Black daughter,&quot; but in a way that connects to the South African president, and in an interesting way. Could you talk about the relationship between your work and a</font>	Transcription
64.951	66.12	<font color='#008080'>diasporic context?</font>	Transcription
66.96	76.74	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
66.961	76.74	<font color='indigo'>Well, that reading that you just gave of that line, &quot;I am a Black daughter,&quot; that break-- It seems to me, and I&#39;m just now thinking about this, echoes Gwendolyn Brooks&#39; great poem</font>	Transcription
76.741	88.74	<font color='indigo'>where she talks about &quot;I am a Black,&quot; &quot;I am one of the Blacks,&quot; where she feels that to be called merely African American is limiting and almost in a way euphemistic. That it skips over an</font>	Transcription
88.741	93.57	<font color='indigo'>understanding of how we are all connected to each other, across the globe.</font>	Transcription
94.051	106.17	<font color='indigo'>Sometimes in our actual histories, in the case of the Jamaican grandfather there&#39;s a lot of personal history in my poems as you know, or in newer poems. My husband is from Eritrea, so now I have a</font>	Transcription
106.171	120.45	<font color='indigo'>whole East African connection going on. But in a way, I think what we learn from those real histories is how complicated and sometimes nostalgic and sometimes full of fantasy, the idea of Africa is</font>	Transcription
120.451	121.14	<font color='indigo'>for us.</font>	Transcription
122.311	133.47	<font color='indigo'>You know, and I think that as African Americans, we have always tried to connect to that idea, because so much has been cut off and interrupted. But at the same time, it&#39;s a fantasy,</font>	Transcription
133.801	145.62	<font color='indigo'>though I think it is a heartfelt and beautiful fantasy that has led many of us, myself included, to reading and learning and reaching out and exploration and trying to theorize in very personal terms:</font>	Transcription
145.801	151.59	<font color='indigo'>What does it mean to be African people in this diaspora all across the world?</font>	Transcription
151.921	165.42	<font color='indigo'>I think also one of the beautiful realities of the United States, and for me of growing up in Washington, DC, is that you met Black people from all over the world. And that&#39;s something I touch on as</font>	Transcription
165.421	172.53	<font color='indigo'>well, something that was very important to my own African American grandmother growing up in Washington, DC.</font>	Transcription
172.531	185.79	<font color='indigo'>She would go and sit on the steps of embassies, because it let her imagine the world. And so that was a fortunate thing to grow up with: just that sense that we are, we are a multi-people.</font>	Transcription
186.39	196.26	<font color='#008080'><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>	Speaker
186.391	196.26	<font color='#008080'>It&#39;s-- I love hearing you talk about that. Because in that poem that, where you actually invoke your grandmother sitting on the steps of embassy row, you have the line where you talk</font>	Transcription
196.261	206.76	<font color='#008080'>about what is a princess like in &#39;Feminist Poem Number One&#39;, what is, uh, what your grandmother would call and say to her-- her international friends, I am an American Negro, right, and what is an</font>	Transcription
206.761	212.07	<font color='#008080'>American Negro princess? And so in some ways, I think that hearing you talk about that--</font>	Transcription
212.221	223.95	<font color='#008080'>and then in that same poem you actually refer to your husband and then talk about, you know, as an Abyssinian. And so its interesting how, within the context of one poem, both in terms of gender</font>	Transcription
223.951	232.77	<font color='#008080'>relationships, in terms of how that intersects our ideas about race and our ideas about kind of connections to Africa, that all gets kind of wrapped up into that,</font>	Transcription
232.921	244.29	<font color='#008080'>as well as class, right? Because anytime you kind of invoke these ideas about the princesses, it&#39;s the sense of the grandmother who wants to travel to see the world and you have traveled to see the</font>	Transcription
244.291	250.74	<font color='#008080'>world, right. Within the context of the line, for the poem the husband that takes you to the airport for a passport, which means of course that you&#39;re--</font>	Transcription

251.341	263.97	<font color='#008080'>You&#39;re going somewhere, right, and eventually coming back. And so I think that&#39;s really a useful way to think about it. But even domestically, I find that your work covers so many</font>	Transcription
263.971	276.87	<font color='#008080'>different kinds of Black artists and authors and photographers and athletes from Mohammed Ali to James Van Der Zee to Paul Robeson to Romero Bearden,</font>	Transcription
277.111	290.94	<font color='#008080'>and I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;d be interested in talking a little bit about, about myth, right, and Black mythic figures and major historical figures that seem to occur in your work. And I note that my</font>	Transcription
291.001	302.28	<font color='#008080'>list-- at this moment I&#39;m using Black male figures because we started, um I moved in a bit of a different direction, but even your, in, Nat Turner poem. Right? So if, would you comment on that?</font>	Transcription
302.51	316.43	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
302.511	316.43	<font color='indigo'>Well yeah, I mean, I think our history, our culture is so rich, it&#39;s so under explored, it&#39;s so distortedly imagined, that it just has always seemed to me that that is an infinite</font>	Transcription
316.431	329.75	<font color='indigo'>mother lode for poetry. I think in some ways, what that speaks to biographically is that I spent a lot of time in school and in universities, although when I think about the reading, that gave me my</font>	Transcription
329.751	333.02	<font color='indigo'>information, very often, it was actually autodidactic study,</font>	Transcription
333.441	348.53	<font color='indigo'>it was not always what I was learning in school. But nonetheless, that context, that idea of reading to know, reading as experience that is deeply, deeply felt, and taken in reading as being-- and</font>	Transcription
348.531	356.42	<font color='indigo'>learning, as somehow on a, an equivalent plane to the things that you know from living your life without books.</font>	Transcription
356.601	370.13	<font color='indigo'>You know, to those of us for whom culture is that important, I think it&#39;s important to assert that it&#39;s lived life, it&#39;s real experience. So calling all of that in, being a scholar of African American</font>	Transcription
370.131	381.41	<font color='indigo'>culture, you know, it&#39;s what I teach, it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking about for a long time, I find that poems are a great place to work with that. That said, this whole idea of myth, you know, I, the</font>	Transcription

408.001	420.09	<font color='#008080'>Yes, yes. Thank you so much. Well, it&#39;s interesting hearing you talk about kind of-- in that context, you being a scholar of African American culture, and a teacher in points being</font>	Transcription
420.091	430.98	<font color='#008080'>the space where you&#39;re able to kind of explore this mother lode, because I&#39;d actually like to talk a little bit about your newest work, &#39;The Black Interior&#39;. And one of the things, you know, first off</font>	Transcription
430.981	437.25	<font color='#008080'>that is different, right, is that it&#39;s a collection of essays obviously, unlike your previous three books before that.</font>	Transcription
437.491	450.81	<font color='#008080'>And it strikes me that it is at once both scholarly, but also attempting to speak to a larger community that is not just dealing with issues of books, right, we have essays in there, one on Julia</font>	Transcription
450.811	460.02	<font color='#008080'>Cooper, of course, so that&#39;s definitely in the kind of intellectual or readerly tradition. But you have an essay on Denzel Washington, right? You have an essay on Rodney King. You have an essay, my</font>	Transcription
460.021	461.52	<font color='#008080'>goodness on <i>Jet</i>, right?</font>	Transcription
461.151	474.53	<font color='#008080'>&quot;Notes Toward a Notion of Race-Pride.&quot; And so there&#39;s a way in which I really see your work as working with both, kind of, the African American scholarly tradition in terms of literary culture, but</font>	Transcription
474.531	488.54	<font color='#008080'>also and I think in important ways, more broadly, popular culture, right, in ways that I think, are useful for students, right? Because I know that, that you also teach. Could you talk about kind of</font>	Transcription
488.811	495.05	<font color='#008080'>the role that you see <i>Black Interior</i> playing in the trajectory of your work as a writer? And--</font>	Transcription
495.44	505.1	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
495.441	505.1	<font color='indigo'>Yeah. Well, I mean, I think one of the things, you know, when you&#39;re taught close reading as a method in graduate study and undergraduate study English classes, it should be</font>	Transcription
505.101	508.25	<font color='indigo'>applicable to anything that constitutes a text.</font>	Transcription
508.25	508.52	<font color='#008080'><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>	Speaker

509.0	521.84	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
509.001	521.84	<font color='indigo'>So there was actually a wonderful article by Stanley Fish, your UIC colleague, at, in the New York Times where he was-- had his students do close readings of a speech by Bush, a</font>	Transcription
521.841	531.2	<font color='indigo'>speech by Kerry. And he talked about repetition, assonance, all the, the-- what we think of as poetic devices of how people do or don&#39;t get their message across.</font>	Transcription
531.271	543.39	<font color='indigo'>How language works on us. So I think those tools, we should be able to turn them anyplace. And while I do think that there are all kinds of things that you can say about, you know, &quot;poetry is not</font>	Transcription
543.421	557.04	<font color='indigo'><i>Jet</i> magazine.&quot; But, at the same time, how does our culture manifest itself? How does it live in people who don&#39;t necessarily call themselves professional artists? And how do a lot of the issues</font>	Transcription
557.041	561.66	<font color='indigo'>that are of importance in our poetry and in our popular culture cross back and forth.</font>	Transcription
561.001	577.62	<font color='indigo'>I&#39;m very interested in that. The book, as you know, was a long time coming, and in many ways that long time is a testimony to the challenges of finding a prose voice. You know, when an academic, a</font>	Transcription
577.621	589.62	<font color='indigo'>more conventionally academic voice didn&#39;t feel like a jacket that fit. And at the same time, I wanted to bring in what I know as an artist, how I look at the world as an artist,</font>	Transcription
589.651	601.92	<font color='indigo'>and I wanted to operate in a tradition of belles lettres that is exemplified by people like June Jordan, who&#39;s a very, very important figure to me, and who&#39;s an incredibly important essayist, and I</font>	Transcription
601.921	606.48	<font color='indigo'>believe, has published more essays than any Black woman in history.</font>	Transcription

606.571	607.02	<font color='#008080'>Yes.</font>	Transcription
607.05	609.51	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
607.051	609.51	<font color='indigo'>I&#39;m pretty sure that that&#39;s, that that&#39;s true.</font>	Transcription
610.0	625.42	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
610.001	625.42	<font color='indigo'>And so what does it mean to, in the way that I love, to listen to a smart person with a wide field of reference, hold forth. Felicitously. I wanted to be that person in writing.</font>	Transcription
610.41	610.5	<font color='#008080'><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>	Speaker
610.411	610.5	<font color='#008080'>Yes.</font>	Transcription
610.541	643.75	<font color='#008080'>And I think that actually also within Blackness, we, we have so many great raconteurs, we have so many oral geniuses who can hold forth, in a way that is just amazing. And so I think that somehow also</font>	Transcription
643.751	656.2	<font color='#008080'>those patterns of address and argument were somehow underneath and in there as well. But finding that voice was challenging. And now that the book is out there, you know, my, my wish and my hope is</font>	Transcription
656.201	660.16	<font color='#008080'>that it find its readers. And I think that&#39;s a slow process too.</font>	Transcription
660.22	661.75	<font color='#008080'><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>	Speaker
660.221	661.75	<font color='#008080'>Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</font>	Transcription

662.501	672.34	<font color='#008080'>Right. Well, I-- well in, within the context of the readership or audience of &#39;Black Interior&#39;, I think different people will come to the book with different needs and expectations.</font>	Transcription
672.341	682.51	<font color='#008080'>And so the nice thing about kind of the aspect of it being a work that looks at different aspects of Black culture in very diverse ways.</font>	Transcription
682.721	693.4	<font color='#008080'>And also, I think, using a language that is not an academic straightjacket, you know, in terms of, as a scholar of African American literature, the tradition, in terms of the scholarly tradition,</font>	Transcription
693.551	699.79	<font color='#008080'>there&#39;s certain expectations about language and kind of heightened language, or what is recognized or thought of as theoretical language.</font>	Transcription
699.791	712.93	<font color='#008080'>And yet, I find in &#39;The Black Interior&#39;, if you think, for example of your essay on Michael Harper, who I know has been an influence on you, that there is a way in which you, you use insightful close</font>	Transcription
712.931	719.71	<font color='#008080'>readings, right, of some of his, of his poems from &#39;Dear John, Dear Coltrane&#39;, and poems, on Bessie Smith, for example,</font>	Transcription
720.581	734.11	<font color='#008080'>but not terminology, that someone who has not taken, you know, American poetry 101 at Yale University would not be able to understand. And I think that&#39;s really important terms of thinking about kind</font>	Transcription
734.111	741.4	<font color='#008080'>of the artist and her relationship to community, right, and to audience in really, really useful ways.</font>	Transcription
741.45	752.79	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
741.451	752.79	<font color='indigo'>And I think also there&#39;s something interesting, I haven&#39;t, I&#39;m just thinking of it this very moment, but something interesting about hierarchy and apprenticeship, in the ways that</font>	Transcription
753.241	764.22	<font color='indigo'>people are quoted, other experts and colleagues are quoted in the essays. But my dad read some of them in an earlier phase, he said, Why do you have to quote 10 people to say what you&#39;re trying to</font>	Transcription
764.221	767.76	<font color='indigo'>say? Just say what you&#39;re trying to say, and-- you&#39;re a grown up.</font>	Transcription

768.241	776.61	<font color='indigo'>Say what you&#39;re trying to say. But of course, you know, in, in academic writing, you have to quote 10 other people, who said what you said first, in order to say what you have to</font>	Transcription
776.611	793.32	<font color='indigo'>say. And yet I do think that there is something within our oral communities about earning the right to speak, and about moving through ancestral wisdom and knowledge in order to have your moment to</font>	Transcription
793.321	800.85	<font color='indigo'>hold forth. So I think that there are different ways of sort of moving through those channels, to your moment in the sun.</font>	Transcription

800.001	810.29	<font color='#008080'>Oh, I&#39;m glad you mentioned that. Because when you think about the kind of oral communities or oral culture in the way that it&#39;s associated with Black culture as an oral culture.</font>	Transcription
810.291	816.17	<font color='#008080'>Though, of course, in terms of scholarship, people are questioning that as a too easy identification.</font>	Transcription
816.321	831.65	<font color='#008080'>But one thing I noticed in your poetry is that, and you mentioned this at a conference at Yale a few years ago, where you&#39;re talking about kind of giving voice to Black female figures within our</font>	Transcription
831.651	838.37	<font color='#008080'>history, that you seem to not be able to find in the historical record, a record of their voice, right? And so,</font>	Transcription
838.521	848.75	<font color='#008080'>you have the poem &quot;Yolande Speaks&quot; right, in which you think about all the literature about Dubois, and even though you know, Gerald Horne has done a wonderful biography of Shirley Dubois, that</font>	Transcription
848.811	862.37	<font color='#008080'>Dubois&#39; daughter, right, his only daughter, we don&#39;t hear her voice as much in the historical record. And there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in which, you know, poems such as that where you have her not only</font>	Transcription
862.371	864.95	<font color='#008080'>have a voice but a perspective, right?</font>	Transcription
864.951	876.5	<font color='#008080'>She&#39;s like: &quot;I&#39;ve laughed/ at my father&#39;s gloves// and spats,&quot; which both humanizes him but also gives her kind of a sense of distance from him to kind of have a perspective on, on him.  Or your, your</font>	Transcription
876.501	888.41	<font color='#008080'>first book of poetry, <i>The Venus Hottentot</i>, which, which opens with, you know-- although it opens with Cuvier by the time we get to Saartjie Bartman&#39;s voice, right, you have her being</font>	Transcription

897.291	911.6	<font color='#008080'>There&#39;s a way in which I think that your work really does speak to the need for an awareness of this kind of orality as an aspect of Black culture without simplifying it.</font>	Transcription

911.631	926.81	<font color='indigo'>Mm hmm. Yes. And I think also with that moment in Venus Hottentot, the idea that we always are trying-- we always know more than we manifest. And that really interests me, both</font>	Transcription
926.811	935.63	<font color='indigo'>with myself, in my own continual-- I think it&#39;s a lifelong process of coming to voice, you know. You get there, okay, but then you keep moving forward,</font>	Transcription

1010.851	1022.76	<font color='#008080'>that really deal with the visual image, right, and the concrete visual image, with visual artists, Bearden, Monet and so forth. The photographers. But, but there&#39;s a way in which I sense your work,</font>	Transcription
1023.001	1032.48	<font color='#008080'>and certainly in essays in <i>The Black Interior</i>, where you talk about how do Blacks relate to kind of the distortion of images of ourselves,</font>	Transcription

1061.171	1073.47	<font color='indigo'>As much as art is so important to me and as much as beautiful books are important to me. And what they came up with was a baby aspirin colored cover with scallop shells alluding as best I could see to</font>	Transcription
1073.471	1084.93	<font color='indigo'>Venus de Milo rising up out of the sea. And I thought, okay, so if after reading that poem, that is the title poem of that book, all-- it sort of proves the thesis.</font>	Transcription

1106.001	1117.13	<font color='indigo'>So the the painting that I chose was a painting by Charles Alston, who&#39;s my great uncle, my mother&#39;s uncle, and it&#39;s called ballet dancer, and it&#39;s a picture of a Black woman--</font>	Transcription
1117.161	1130.9	<font color='indigo'>too bad the picture couldn&#39;t have been in color because you can see it&#39;s sort of yellows and olives. She looks a bit whiter colored than she actually is in the reproduction, but she has a kind of</font>	Transcription
1130.931	1132.46	<font color='indigo'>physical composure.</font>	Transcription
1132.761	1143.32	<font color='indigo'>That seemed to me to be very important as that relates to The Venus Hottentot. What does it mean to be that woman who&#39;s-- she&#39;s in leotards, her body is outlined and exposed, but yet, even though you</font>	Transcription
1143.321	1152.92	<font color='indigo'>are being watched, your inner life is your own. That was what I thought was in that implacable face in that, in that painting.</font>	Transcription
1153.431	1163.69	<font color='indigo'>And so ever after, you know I just, it was with &#39;Body of Life&#39; which is Tia Chucha press, they were very excited to have me find my own cover, and this is by a great painter, who&#39;s a friend of mine,</font>	Transcription
1163.691	1177.67	<font color='indigo'>Kerry James Marshall. And there&#39;s a lot of romantic dynamics in this book and this painting is called &quot;Could This be Love&quot;. And just a fabulous painting with so many small details that you can just</font>	Transcription
1177.671	1178.45	<font color='indigo'>about make up:</font>	Transcription
1178.601	1190.6	<font color='indigo'>the calendar stained with her menstrual blood, the sculpture, the Africanesque sculpture in the background echoing her form. All that Kerry James Marshall does with the black black that is not the</font>	Transcription
1190.601	1207.1	<font color='indigo'>color of anyone, but is a color of sort of mythos in a way. The songs in the background, he&#39;s saying, &quot;What a woman, what a woman, what a woman.&quot; So there&#39;s just a lot you know, the, the Vodoun heart</font>	Transcription
1207.371	1208.09	<font color='indigo'>in there.</font>	Transcription
1208.631	1223.96	<font color='indigo'>So much going on, a very talky painting in a way that I think, communicates nicely with the paintings inside. Then in &#39;Antebellum Dream Book&#39; again, the first cover that was given to me-- I said</font>	Transcription
1223.961	1230.92	<font color='indigo'>again, I&#39;m at a new press, a press that I love, let me see what they do. And it was a picture of, you know I said it looked like the cover to Sounder.</font>	Transcription

1244.001	1254.5	<font color='indigo'>How, with, with the book in-- and so I said, can&#39;t work with this, we got to just start all over again. And this painting is Bob Thompson&#39;s &quot;The Garden of Music,&quot; which I just</font>	Transcription
1254.531	1263.95	<font color='indigo'>adore. And because there are dream poems in the book, I felt that there was a very dreamlike quality, a surreal quality to these wonderful purple people.</font>	Transcription
1263.001	1276.89	<font color='indigo'>And, you know, that, that it was a dreamscape in a way that I thought worked with the books, the poems inside. And then with Black Interior, we&#39;ve spoken at the conference, Sonia Sanchez mentioned,</font>	Transcription
1277.101	1282.23	<font color='indigo'>the great Elizabeth Catlett. And this image is called &quot;The Black Woman Speaks&quot;.</font>	Transcription

1283.131	1292.67	<font color='indigo'>You know, and there it is. And as I talk about in the book, what you can&#39;t see on the picture, on the side, there is a sort of a spiral that&#39;s inscribed on her temple, if you were</font>	Transcription
1292.671	1305.27	<font color='indigo'>to have a side view. And you know, the spiral is a symbol of infinity, and it seems to me that that it also suggests, it almost-- as though it&#39;s a drawing of what&#39;s inside the Black woman&#39;s head.</font>	Transcription

1305.901	1320.99	<font color='indigo'>An infinite, infinite spiral. And Catlett made this work in about 1970, when she herself was a very, very mature artist, mother of grown children. Which connects with my</font>	Transcription

1347.781	1359.27	<font color='indigo'>picture of a sculpture, which is hard to do sometimes. But to me, you know, I&#39;m interested in artists&#39; careers over time, you know, want to be in it for the long haul. And so and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so</font>	Transcription

1389.871	1401.96	<font color='#008080'>Me as well. I can definitely identify with that. Thank you so much for that. I want to ask a more just simply basic question, since I&#39;ve been-- How do you know when you are ready to</font>	Transcription
1401.961	1403.43	<font color='#008080'>start or finish a poem?</font>	Transcription
1404.11	1416.47	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
1404.111	1416.47	<font color='indigo'>Ooh. Well at this conference I have felt really ready to start a lot of poems. I think that being around poetry and being around people who make poetry makes new poems happen, you</font>	Transcription
1416.471	1430.69	<font color='indigo'>know. It&#39;s like this incredible, biodynamic thing that, that happens, you just sort of-- you take a word, you take a line, you take a sort of a modal imprint, and the poems are ready to come.</font>	Transcription
1431.801	1440.86	<font color='indigo'>And then for me, as for all of us, there&#39;s always the question of time, and where to find-- you know, I love that Lucille Clifton, when she was talking about what it was to have four children in</font>	Transcription
1440.861	1444.25	<font color='indigo'>diapers at the same time. And she said to the audience, you think you&#39;re busy?</font>	Transcription
1444.4	1445.87	<font color='#008080'><b>Meta DuEwa Jones</b></font>	Speaker
1444.401	1445.87	<font color='#008080'>Right. Right. Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
1445.87	1456.94	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
1445.871	1456.94	<font color='indigo'>And she has spoken about actually how the ideal circumstances for her to write poetry became domestic chaos.  Because that&#39;s what it was. You know, that if you know, she says,</font>	Transcription
1456.941	1466.42	<font color='indigo'>one-- you&#39;re at the kitchen table, and one child&#39;s got the measles and the other child&#39;s got the homework and that everything is going on. Nonetheless, you somehow make that space. And I am working to</font>	Transcription
1466.421	1475.12	<font color='indigo'>do that as I think whether or not we have children we&#39;re always, in the midst of our lives, we all have to make a living. No poet is supporting him or herself solely by the word.</font>	Transcription
1475.631	1489.7	<font color='indigo'>So you&#39;re trying to make that bubble, or develop the habit that says, at least in my bag, the notebook is always there. Although, because driving ends up sometimes to be the only free time there is.</font>	Transcription
1490.391	1499.75	<font color='indigo'>Can&#39;t quite write the things down as well, you know, on the road, as well as you would like to. So it&#39;s that feeling though, which I&#39;m having now which I&#39;m having after this conference of being full</font>	Transcription
1499.751	1500.02	<font color='indigo'>up.</font>	Transcription
1501.671	1513.16	<font color='indigo'>And then you know, then there&#39;s process, process, process. But then the ready to be done with it is a tricky thing as well. I was speaking with some students recently about how you sort of go as far</font>	Transcription
1513.161	1525.76	<font color='indigo'>as you can, and then you leave it and come back to it after it&#39;s had time to sit. And then you can more clearly see, okay, was I just tired? Was I just out of ideas? Or maybe this really is done.</font>	Transcription
1526.181	1539.05	<font color='indigo'>Or maybe now I can see what the final tweak is. And I have poems that have remained in folders for years and years and years and years, snippets for years, that then you find, okay, this is how I can</font>	Transcription
1539.051	1541.06	<font color='indigo'>use this. This is how I can complete this.</font>	Transcription

1544.341	1556.43	<font color='indigo'>Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, hopefully, what happens when you get lucky, is that there&#39;s a rush in the beginning, that at least gets a large chunk sketched out. Though, that then</font>	Transcription
1556.431	1564.8	<font color='indigo'>also will be revised and revised and revised. But I like when there&#39;s enough-- that mysterious enoughness to put the poem over the cliff.</font>	Transcription

1601.001	1613.39	<font color='indigo'>Yeah, yeah. There are some that I&#39;m extra proud of mostly because of the work. You know, &#39;The Venus Hottentot&#39;, I worked very, very hard on it, to keep those two voices distinct</font>	Transcription
1613.391	1627.31	<font color='indigo'>and consistent, and to really take myself into a very, very other world of imagination. So I was proud of it as work. In this new collection, I have a really long, a 25 page poem on the Amistad.</font>	Transcription
1628.121	1640.96	<font color='indigo'>I&#39;ve been working on it for years. I&#39;ve done a ton of research. You know, I&#39;m proud of it, because it was hard, good work. And I tried to be meticulous and faithful. I mean, you know, you always are,</font>	Transcription
1641.021	1646.96	<font color='indigo'>but maybe it&#39;s the-- it&#39;s easier to be proud of the sort of bigger projects in a sense.</font>	Transcription
1647.531	1665.32	<font color='indigo'>But I think also moments in poems where I know I have been true, when I could have been cute? Meaning, just clever or, you know, a fancy word but maybe not the right word, or you know, a wonderful</font>	Transcription
1666.731	1671.89	<font color='indigo'>music, but only for its own sake, and not furthering anything in the poem.</font>	Transcription
1672.191	1686.26	<font color='indigo'>You know, moments where I have avoided cuteness or showiness, which has been ingrained in me as a modus operandi from a very early age. You know, my grandmother, if anyone said, you know, to any child</font>	Transcription

1825.261	1837.86	<font color='indigo'>of the Hayden sonnets, specifically &quot;Those Winter Sundays&quot; in <i>Frederick Douglass</i>, which I think redefine what a sonnet can be. And then where my thinking took me, and I thought, well, what</font>	Transcription
1837.861	1844.22	<font color='indigo'>makes &quot;Those Winter Sundays&quot; such a great Hayden sonnet is that the blues cracked open the sonnet form.</font>	Transcription
