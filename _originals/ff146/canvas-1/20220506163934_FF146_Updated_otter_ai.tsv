23.071	35.91	<font color='#008080'>Okay. Kwame, Tell me. Your poem &quot;Ward 21&quot;. It was written for your brother. It seems like that would have been a painful poem to write.</font>	Transcription
36.8	48.95	<font color='navy'><b>Kwame Dawes</b></font>	Speaker
36.801	48.95	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s a part of a longer sequence. And it was difficult to write. It&#39;s funny, because I guess when I come to write the poem, or the process of writing the poem, you&#39;re-- I&#39;m so sort of</font>	Transcription
48.951	59.84	<font color='navy'>taken up with the processes, just the idea of the form and trying to make the thing work, that the pain of it doesn&#39;t really hit until I&#39;m looking back at the poem and starting to contemplate it.</font>	Transcription
59.001	70.79	<font color='navy'>And I&#39;m thinking of an audience, I&#39;m thinking of him reading it, and I&#39;m thinking of sort of being around family who may know the poem and so on. But the stuff that is behind the poem-- that is the</font>	Transcription
70.821	78.47	<font color='navy'>history, the narrative history-- is clearly painful. I mean, it was a difficult time.</font>	Transcription
79.551	91.67	<font color='navy'>Because the poem tells, is part of a longer narrative about, about my younger brother who had a nervous breakdown at age 14. And the discovery 20 years later that what had happened was he was actually</font>	Transcription
91.671	95.93	<font color='navy'>suffering from post traumatic stress because of some abusive situation he had been caught in.</font>	Transcription
96.381	109.52	<font color='navy'>And so the, the shock of discovering that years later sent me to write the poems. In fact, I started write-- I wrote a memoir, I wrote a whole book, which I haven&#39;t published yet, but I wrote a whole</font>	Transcription
109.521	120.62	<font color='navy'>book first. And then I said, you know, probably, I should do this with poetry, which might be, might give me a chance to come at it from different directions and different angles. Yeah.</font>	Transcription
121.05	122.55	<font color='#008080'><b>Tyehimba Jess</b></font>	Speaker
121.051	122.55	<font color='#008080'>So has he read the poems?</font>	Transcription
122.6	133.04	<font color='navy'><b>Kwame Dawes</b></font>	Speaker
122.601	133.04	<font color='navy'>He hasn&#39;t read the poems. I think he&#39;s read a couple of the poems. And so, but you know, we talk about it. I mean he&#39;s, I guess he&#39;s cool with it. There&#39;s a certain kind of notoriety that</font>	Transcription
133.041	139.88	<font color='navy'>comes with it as well. Everybody in the world is gonna know about him, so I guess that&#39;s good.</font>	Transcription
140.031	155.21	<font color='navy'>But it is as much his story. And there&#39;s a great statement that a number of memoir writers have said, and, and I tie this with memoir, even though this is a sequence of poems, because the problems of</font>	Transcription
155.211	165.65	<font color='navy'>deciding what to write about, and the problems of writing about something that is rooted in a personal history is common with both the poems and with a memoir, I think.</font>	Transcription
165.861	177.47	<font color='navy'>And one of the interesting things that I was encouraged by a number of memoir writers is when they tell you that look, remember, this is your story. It&#39;s his story, but it&#39;s really my story. Because</font>	Transcription
177.471	187.1	<font color='navy'>part of the tension of those poems is the way that I reacted to what he went through.</font>	Transcription
187.401	200.06	<font color='navy'>Right, this combination of, I mean, anybody who has been through a situation where we, you have some kind of mental illness in the family, it&#39;s a combination of deep sorrow, incredible anger, because</font>	Transcription
200.061	213.89	<font color='navy'>of this disruption, and guilt. All of those emotions are tied to me more than anything else, so that his emotional space is not as mine as mine is in the poem. So it&#39;s really my story. And so I guess</font>	Transcription
213.891	215.96	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m the one who comes off bad.</font>	Transcription

231.681	243.17	<font color='navy'>No, no, no. And I don&#39;t think about that when I&#39;m writing or when I&#39;m working on something. I think about that only when I&#39;m thinking of publishing it. And that&#39;s when I&#39;m organizing it</font>	Transcription
243.171	247.73	<font color='navy'>and when I&#39;m trying to see how to cast it and so on so forth. And I&#39;m thinking about that now.</font>	Transcription
248.661	267.65	<font color='navy'>But I don&#39;t panic too much about that question. I really don&#39;t. Probably because there&#39;s no shame in it for us, you see, and that&#39;s, to me, the most important thing. And there&#39;s something liberating</font>	Transcription
267.651	278.93	<font color='navy'>about-- the story ends well, put it that way. You know, it ends positively in that sense, that there&#39;s stability and there&#39;s truth, we come to truth. And that to me is very important. Yeah.</font>	Transcription

343.151	354.13	<font color='navy'>I mean, so it sounds, it&#39;s hilarious, because in my head, you know, I&#39;m not thinking wow I&#39;ve published all these books. In my head, I&#39;m thinking, Man, you know, this book didn&#39;t get done, this book</font>	Transcription
354.131	366.07	<font color='navy'>didn&#39;t, and so on and so forth. But I work on tons of projects at the same time. Because I&#39;m fascinated about all these areas. I write about literature because I like writing about literature. I don&#39;t</font>	Transcription
366.071	375.07	<font color='navy'>do it because it&#39;s part of my job. I do it because I&#39;m passionate about it. And I write poems, because if I don&#39;t write poems regularly, I feel as if something is wrong with me.</font>	Transcription

490.871	503.44	<font color='navy'>That&#39;s an interesting question, I&#39;m not sure. I wish I was a better guitarist. That&#39;s one thing I always wish. I wish I was a better musician. I never got music lessons growing up. I</font>	Transcription
503.441	505.69	<font color='navy'>mean, it&#39;s a peculiar thing. My father was a musician.</font>	Transcription
506.251	516.39	<font color='navy'>We didn&#39;t know this until I was in maybe my teens. I didn&#39;t know he was a jazz musician until I was in my teens when we ran into him, happened to be playing some piano. He took us somewhere. And he</font>	Transcription
516.391	525.24	<font color='navy'>must have just gone in there and was fiddling with this piano, because we didn&#39;t have a piano in the house. And I, you know, we heard this man playing, you know, Monk, what is going on here?</font>	Transcription

526.001	536.53	<font color='navy'>I was about 13, 14. This is the first I knew this man played the piano. And then of course, he told us, of course, he played with a jazz combo, you know, growing up in Jamaica, and so.</font>	Transcription

536.791	537.99	<font color='#008080'>And your father was a writer as well?</font>	Transcription
537.96	546.93	<font color='navy'><b>Kwame Dawes</b></font>	Speaker
537.961	546.93	<font color='navy'>Yeah and he was a writer as well, right. But we never took music lessons. You know, I mean, this man used to watch us trying to play pans and hitting boxes, and he would just walk by--</font>	Transcription
546.931	556.83	<font color='navy'>the man couldn&#39;t even think think, let me give them a lesson. You know what I&#39;m saying? Let me just pay for somebody to just-- nothing, you know, they&#39;re having fun and so on. So I came to play the</font>	Transcription
556.831	566.7	<font color='navy'>guitar. You know, in my teens in my late teens, and a friend of mine taught me a few chords. My wife who was my girlfriend at the time, she taught me some chords and so on. And she was she was very</font>	Transcription
566.701	568.86	<font color='navy'>good and she had been trained as a musician.</font>	Transcription
569.251	580.47	<font color='navy'>And I started jamming with a few chords. I started to write songs and so on. And my attitude is if I know some chords, I&#39;m gonna write some songs. And so that part of that process was interesting,</font>	Transcription
580.471	584.31	<font color='navy'>which when I started working with the band and writing songs for the band I wrote on the guitar.</font>	Transcription
584.821	597.75	<font color='navy'>And I love that process, but I&#39;m not sure what the connection might be. I mean, I think for me, it&#39;s what I like to listen to and I like to listen to folks like Dylan and of course, Marley and Paul</font>	Transcription
597.751	602.61	<font color='navy'>Simon, and so a lot of guitar-driven songwriters. They fascinate me.</font>	Transcription

602.731	610.95	<font color='#008080'>And one thing that I&#39;ve noticed often in your biographies is a reference to the first time you heard &quot;Natty Dread&quot;. Could you tell us about that?</font>	Transcription
610.95	621.06	<font color='navy'><b>Kwame Dawes</b></font>	Speaker
610.951	621.06	<font color='navy'>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, &quot;Natty Dread&quot; is pivotal for many reasons. I mean, it&#39;s one of those poems in the sense that-- and of course, I&#39;ve written a poem about it, because that works well, too.</font>	Transcription
621.631	634.29	<font color='navy'>But it&#39;s-- my father, who was was a jazz musician, loved jazz, And so his thing was to listen to, I mean he loved Monk, Monk was the guy he listened to a lot in the house. And, but we knew he had I</font>	Transcription
634.291	635.28	<font color='navy'>mean, he was a Pan-Africanist.</font>	Transcription
635.791	645.3	<font color='navy'>My father grew up in Jamaica, was born in Nigeria, came to Jamaica when he was about two. His parents were missionaries in Nigeria, right, Black missionaries in Nigeria. And he came to Jamaica when he</font>	Transcription
645.301	654.9	<font color='navy'>was two years old, went on to study at Oxford University, and then went to Ghana, which is where he was teaching and met my mother and so on. So that&#39;s where I was born. So he had a strong kind of</font>	Transcription
654.931	656.4	<font color='navy'>Pan-Africanist sensibility,</font>	Transcription
656.901	667.64	<font color='navy'>But he was also an Oxford man, you know, Oxford, so he was a very -- he&#39;d speak with his Oxford accent. And so there&#39;s a really weird thing going on, because this was a sort of -- and Marxist, like,</font>	Transcription
667.641	679.25	<font color='navy'>to the bone. I mean, my father was a hardcore Marxist. So, so I grew up in that space. And therefore, it made sense that he would be hooked into Marley, but it didn&#39;t make sense at a certain level,</font>	Transcription
679.251	680.3	<font color='navy'>the connect wasn&#39;t there.</font>	Transcription
680.301	692.84	<font color='navy'>Well, one day the man brings home a little sort of 45, you know, vinyl 45. And he plops it on, puts the thing on and it&#39;s Natty Dread, right? And he plays that over and over again, telling us to sit</font>	Transcription
692.841	701.87	<font color='navy'>down and listen to it. And, you know, he&#39;s played it eight times and he says-- and then he takes it off and then he says, You need to pay attention to this. This is very important. And he goes back to</font>	Transcription
701.871	704.21	<font color='navy'>his corner, reads his book and smokes a cigarette.</font>	Transcription

734.511	745.67	<font color='navy'>And he got it about Marley, then. Before Marley was huge, or anything, and he was telling us pay attention to this guy. And I never stopped paying attention to Marley after that.</font>	Transcription

749.961	759.59	<font color='navy'>Yeah, I&#39;ve written about Marley. Yeah. I&#39;ve written about reggae. Yeah, because reggae is-- the 1970s is when I grew up, you know, I grew up in the &#39;70s, Jamaica. This was the period</font>	Transcription
759.591	771.11	<font color='navy'>where there was incredible political tension going on. This is the fear when Michael Manley was the Prime Minister experimenting with socialism, having strong relationships with Cuba, right. And at</font>	Transcription
771.111	779.33	<font color='navy'>the same time, making connections with Africa, which prior to that Jamaicans were not necessarily interested in, right, because there&#39;s the whole colonial attitude to Africa.</font>	Transcription
779.331	789.5	<font color='navy'>So in the 70s, Samora Machel comes to Jamaica, Nyerere comes to Jamaica, I mean everybody&#39;s coming to Jamaica, so Africa has a presence. My father, who was working at the Institute of Jamaica starts</font>	Transcription
789.501	801.29	<font color='navy'>this thing called the African Caribbean Institute. So there&#39;s all this cross pollination, and there&#39;s-- beauty queens get darker and darker, you know, all kinds of things are happening in this very</font>	Transcription
801.321	802.64	<font color='navy'>volatile world.</font>	Transcription
802.641	815.21	<font color='navy'>Because in &#39;76, we get political elections going on with tremendous violence in &#39;80 a lot of violence going on. And in the cauldron of all of this energy, reggae emerges, like an explosion! I mean,</font>	Transcription
815.211	827.42	<font color='navy'>Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Burning Spear, Peter Tosh, you know, Culture, The Gladiators, and song group after song group, hitting the world and really transforming it. And I&#39;m sitting in the middle of</font>	Transcription

833.661	846.08	<font color='navy'>So reggae becomes an aesthetic framework out of which I think my work emerges, and it shapes and directs that work and helps me to interpret not only the work of the &#39;70s and the &#39;80s, but the work</font>	Transcription
846.081	858.8	<font color='navy'>prior to that. Because it becomes a prism through which one begins to understand the literary practice of Africans in the diaspora, a practice that comes out of radical action, revolution, resistance,</font>	Transcription
859.101	867.23	<font color='navy'>and mixing that with religion, and sex, and rhythm, and all of that. And that&#39;s all contained in reggae music.</font>	Transcription

867.481	878.46	<font color='#008080'>Well, how would you say, I guess I would say the Afro-Caribbean literary tradition, has affected the African American literary tradition and vice versa?</font>	Transcription
878.76	888.3	<font color='navy'><b>Kwame Dawes</b></font>	Speaker
878.761	888.3	<font color='navy'>Well, you&#39;re asking the wrong person because, you know, I&#39;m from Jamaica, and basically, we invented everything. For instance, Adam and Eve really started in Jamaica. I mean, most people</font>	Transcription
888.301	899.76	<font color='navy'>don&#39;t know this, right? I mean, that&#39;s like the beginning of all things, right? And so I may be hyperbolic in some of the things I might say, but just a tad, just a smidgen. But there&#39;s a great</font>	Transcription
899.791	908.85	<font color='navy'>influence. I mean, I mean, let&#39;s be real though. You know, people talk about Bob Marley now, and everybody knows Bob Marley. Look in the &#39;70s African Americans were not listening to Bob Marley.</font>	Transcription
908.001	919.46	<font color='navy'>I mean, Bob Marley-- the people who were following Bob Marley were white college students. Simple as that. And the reason why African Americans were not so deeply ingrained into Bob Marley as they</font>	Transcription
919.461	931.01	<font color='navy'>might be now was because there was an African American music tradition happening, that was doing the job that it needed to do. I mean, this is Marvin Gaye style. This is Stevie Wonder. This is when</font>	Transcription
931.011	935.36	<font color='navy'>these political voices are emerging in the music, right? This is the Funkadelic this is--</font>	Transcription
935.571	946.79	<font color='navy'>Something is going on here that is quite revolutionary and radical, which is influencing Jamaica. But when you get to the late &#39;70s, you begin to see the connection taking place. And there is no</font>	Transcription
946.791	959.15	<font color='navy'>accident that hip hop emerges, right, in the in the late &#39;70s, early &#39;80s. Because that&#39;s dancehall music, and it&#39;s influenced. Many of the dancehall musicians would migrate to New York, and were part</font>	Transcription
959.151	963.38	<font color='navy'>of the Bronx scene, parts of the Brooklyn scene and influencing the hip hop.</font>	Transcription
963.591	974.99	<font color='navy'>And that is very much a part of that, that shapes it. And intellectually, I mean Stokely Carmichael, right? I mean, a number of important-- think, Michael Thelwell, all of these guys coming out of the</font>	Transcription
974.991	985.22	<font color='navy'>Caribbean and having an impact on Black Arts Movement, having an impact on Black issues, and Black political issues. All of that is going on at the same time.</font>	Transcription
985.221	996.2	<font color='navy'>So there are these interesting and fascinating connections. I mean, one of the things people don&#39;t know is Amiri Baraka has-- one of his early chapbooks in the early &#39;70s, maybe mid &#39;70s is a reggae</font>	Transcription
996.201	1001.72	<font color='navy'>chapbook. See, people don&#39;t know that. Even Baraka was a reggae man.</font>	Transcription
1003.431	1016.3	<font color='navy'>So yeah. And he got it. It&#39;s called something like &#39;reggae regatta&#39; or something, right? Yeah, it&#39;s a little-- somebody found it at a flea market and brought it to me and I thought, wow! I mean, I</font>	Transcription
1016.301	1026.41	<font color='navy'>have a cherished thing, I don&#39;t think many people have this thing. But I have it in my, you know, I have it at home. Right? So there is an influence. I think that influence is there because the</font>	Transcription
1026.411	1030.16	<font color='navy'>connection makes sense. It&#39;s the shared history, right?</font>	Transcription
1030.341	1040.18	<font color='navy'>But there is a difference, right? The histories are different. We, you know, in Jamaica, you grew up Black, you&#39;re you know, 80 percent to 90 percent of the population, that&#39;s different. The political</font>	Transcription
1040.181	1051.79	<font color='navy'>dynamics are different than if you grew up Black, say in Mississippi. If you grew up Black in South Carolina, now, you&#39;re 40 percent, which is high. But it&#39;s not nothing like, you know, being 90</font>	Transcription
1051.791	1057.64	<font color='navy'>percent of the population. And anywhere else in America, you&#39;re down to, you know, 20 and 30 percent. That&#39;s where you&#39;re falling in.</font>	Transcription
1057.941	1068.44	<font color='navy'>When that happens, the idea of the relationship between the sort of dominant, mainstream culture becomes quite different. And the politics of that are quite, quite different.</font>	Transcription

1083.501	1093.55	<font color='navy'>Um, no, not it didn&#39;t change. I mean, I began to read more, but I mean I was reading African American literature from-- you know, as Bob Marley would say, from ever since. Listen, I mean,</font>	Transcription
1093.551	1106.36	<font color='navy'>you know, like the poster girl for me growing up in the &#39;70s was Angela Davis. I mean, we had her poster with that fro. And she&#39;s fine. I mean there was all of that going on. I was into that. I mean,</font>	Transcription

1112.661	1125.47	<font color='navy'>We had all those books, all that information at home growing up with it. So as is typical, remember, this United States is a powerhouse of a nation, and Americans will know less about the world than</font>	Transcription
1125.471	1136.27	<font color='navy'>the world knows about America. And that&#39;s just the reality of it. So I didn&#39;t come into America ignorant. I didn&#39;t come to South Carolina ignorant, but I came with biases. I came with perceptions that</font>	Transcription
1136.271	1143.5	<font color='navy'>came out of media that came out of things I might have read and so on. For instance, I thought I knew what grits was, apparently I didn&#39;t.</font>	Transcription
1145.631	1158.08	<font color='navy'>Didn&#39;t know it was porridge. Turns out it&#39;s porridge. And I don&#39;t like porridge. So I thought I would like grits, right? That didn&#39;t work out so well. But so there are a lot of things I didn&#39;t really</font>	Transcription
1158.081	1162.97	<font color='navy'>understand, and the dynamics of race and the South I didn&#39;t really understand until coming here.</font>	Transcription
1163.561	1170.58	<font color='navy'>But I&#39;ve moved around a lot. I&#39;ve lived in England, lived in Ghana, lived in Jamaica, lived in a few places. And one of the things that-- I lived in Canada for a number of years-- so one of the things</font>	Transcription
1170.581	1181.47	<font color='navy'>that I always learned was wherever I am, I am going to create my art out of that space and out of the community that I connect with there.</font>	Transcription
1181.861	1193.59	<font color='navy'>And very quickly, one of the first things I did when I went to Sumpter, which was a small town in South Carolina, was to go to the Black, the African American community center, work with them, meet</font>	Transcription
1193.591	1203.67	<font color='navy'>the elders in the community. I interviewed the women especially as a way to learn more about them, but as a way for them to welcome me and teach me something about that community.</font>	Transcription
1204.061	1215.43	<font color='navy'>And that made a tremendous difference in my understanding of who I am. My understanding of what place I have and what connection I have to that place itself. And a lot of my work comes out of that</font>	Transcription

1253.951	1265.23	<font color='navy'>Most of my time is spent reading other people&#39;s work, writing blurbs, writing analyses of it, helping people with their-- and this is writers from major published writers to writers who are just</font>	Transcription

1319.17	1330.24	<font color='navy'><b>Kwame Dawes</b></font>	Speaker
1319.171	1330.24	<font color='navy'>There are huge changes. And the changes come from-- Look, one of the interesting things about our art and about the politics and the shaping of the perception of that art is that often,</font>	Transcription
1330.241	1343.53	<font color='navy'>if you don&#39;t create movements that can give it a profile, what happens is that the art continues without any kind of focal attention to it. It is artificial in many ways, when we declare a movement</font>	Transcription
1343.531	1350.01	<font color='navy'>when we declare that there&#39;s this new sort of school of writing and all that. It is artificial, and it&#39;s calculated, right?</font>	Transcription
1350.001	1360.77	<font color='navy'>And it&#39;s done again and again. And it&#39;s done to give attention to what is happening in the work. But it&#39;s also done to give it a point of reference. Now what happened with Furious Flower one, I think,</font>	Transcription
1360.771	1370.82	<font color='navy'>is that it brought so many voices together and said, look at what we are doing and look at what we&#39;ve become. And Furious Flower two is looking at a movement. And that particular moment, of course, is</font>	Transcription
1370.821	1377.93	<font color='navy'>the Black Arts Movement which is really a kind of focal point. But that is a credible and a clearly defined movement, you see.</font>	Transcription
1378.531	1390.77	<font color='navy'>What is happening today is to me even more fascinating. And it&#39;s fascinating because I think there are so many writers writing, but it is also a true reflection of what is happening in America in</font>	Transcription
1390.771	1405.83	<font color='navy'>defining African American-- the nature of African American resistance, and African American action today. You can&#39;t use the model of the of the &#39;60s, because the landscape has changed. But you can</font>	Transcription
1405.831	1412.07	<font color='navy'>draw from the model of the &#39;60s. But then you have to have a redefinition of your new model and how you&#39;re going to deal with it.</font>	Transcription
1412.071	1422.87	<font color='navy'>Because you see, you&#39;re not dealing with with Motown now. What you&#39;re dealing with, you&#39;re dealing with hip hop now. And now hip hop is a very complicated thing, right? And what we haven&#39;t done yet</font>	Transcription
1422.871	1429.74	<font color='navy'>enough of, and I&#39;m noticing that people are starting to deal with it, is to really try and get what is happening with hip hop.</font>	Transcription
1429.001	1441.9	<font color='navy'>How do you mix the materialistic element of it-- which is the bling-bling, the money-- with the idea of resistance? How do you rationalize that? How do you impose or how do you introduce ideas of</font>	Transcription
1441.901	1452.37	<font color='navy'>signify in the midst of that pressure, right? Those elements become important. Now, when you have a Rita Dove and a Yusef Komunyakaa and all of these names who are big names, and are recognized as big</font>	Transcription
1452.371	1461.61	<font color='navy'>poetic names, and they get all the major awards and so on, it changes the landscape, in the sense of what you can say about attention we&#39;re getting and all those kinds of things.</font>	Transcription
1462.031	1474.84	<font color='navy'>So I think the challenge for today&#39;s poet is to say, what is this world I&#39;m living in now? What is the thing-- what are the things that affect our community? And what is the language that we are going</font>	Transcription
1474.841	1485.49	<font color='navy'>to use today to speak to that community. Right? And that, to me, is the biggest challenge that faces many writers. The opportunities are there, but I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re grappling with that as much.</font>	Transcription
1485.821	1496.29	<font color='navy'>And I see that the Furious Flower gives people a chance to look at it, to see where it&#39;s coming from, but hopefully to start asking, what is our voice saying now? And I think the closest thing that</font>	Transcription
1496.291	1507.27	<font color='navy'>comes to doing that is Cave Canem. I really think that. And it is the one entity that brings all these African American poets together and forces them to ask themselves questions about what they&#39;re</font>	Transcription
1507.271	1520.62	<font color='navy'>doing. It&#39;s the one entity that&#39;s doing that about now. Not about then, but about now, Right? And it&#39;s very interesting what happens in that in that space. Very, very interesting. Yeah.</font>	Transcription

1560.571	1570.59	<font color='navy'>Yeah, yeah. Cave Canem is a good model and its work-- I mean we&#39;ve taken from Cave Canem to do work in Jamaica with the Calabash Writer&#39;s Festival, plus the writer&#39;s workshops that we do</font>	Transcription
1570.591	1580.58	<font color='navy'>there and so on. And we are publishing work by writers now. We&#39;ve seen work that came out of those workshops that we published here in the States and so on. Cave Canem is a very effective model. The</font>	Transcription
1580.581	1585.83	<font color='navy'>idea is what you&#39;re saying is that-- and remember we&#39;re not dealing with a minority group in Jamaica, right?</font>	Transcription
1585.001	1600.03	<font color='navy'>But we&#39;re saying: Let&#39;s bring a nurturing space for writers to come together and to treat their work with respect, but with a hard-edged integrity, about quality, and about craft. And that&#39;s</font>	Transcription
1600.031	1612.0	<font color='navy'>important, that is really important. It&#39;s the challenge. It&#39;s to challenge the easy path. It&#39;s to say, if you get up and you say something, and you say, revolution, do you know what the heck you&#39;re</font>	Transcription
1612.001	1612.9	<font color='navy'>talking about?</font>	Transcription
1612.961	1622.59	<font color='navy'>Do you know what that means? Do you understand the implications of that? Or is it a good word that rhymes with absolution? I mean, you know, are you you know, do you understand what is going on in the</font>	Transcription
1622.591	1633.63	<font color='navy'>midst of that. And so Cave Canem offers that model, but that model can be replicated all through, right? And in the work I do, I started something called a South Carolina Poetry Initiative. Now,</font>	Transcription
1633.631	1646.41	<font color='navy'>that&#39;s not something for African American writers. But there&#39;s something about creating an institution as a Black person in South Carolina, that assures Black writers that this space is welcome to me.</font>	Transcription
1647.251	1656.76	<font color='navy'>And so what these people in South Carolina suddenly see is that so many poets are coming to the events that we have, the collaborations that we have, and are responding to it, and they&#39;re people of</font>	Transcription
1656.761	1669.93	<font color='navy'>all races, and coming together around the idea of poetry. Right? So I think that what we are looking for in the future is true, the spirit of Cave Canem is very important. But at the same time it is</font>	Transcription
1669.931	1673.5	<font color='navy'>to get people in institutions that really have an impact.</font>	Transcription
1673.711	1687.27	<font color='navy'>For instance, there are so few people, African Americans, in publishing. Period. They&#39;re not there. So what do we end up doing? We create, you know, we don&#39;t have people in the positions to look at</font>	Transcription
1687.271	1696.66	<font color='navy'>the work that is emerging, and that is coming on? Well, what that means is that we got to get people involved in publishing. Get them involved in that field, that area, even if it&#39;s to create a new</font>	Transcription

1772.761	1784.94	<font color='navy'>all of this? You know, will I ever be on the bill, right? Now I&#39;ve just got to do the open mic, you know, will I ever get a break? And I knew that feeling because I&#39;ve been in that place, right?</font>	Transcription
1785.001	1796.4	<font color='navy'>Even here in the States. I had published three books of poems. But if I came to a Black African American conference, nobody would know who I was. Because my books were published in England. Right? And</font>	Transcription
1796.401	1809.06	<font color='navy'>nobody knows who you are if your books are published in England, in America. That&#39;s just the way it is, right? But what I say to them is No, think about why you&#39;re working. Come back to why you&#39;re</font>	Transcription
1809.061	1816.5	<font color='navy'>working, why you have the passion for your work, and let that be the driving force and the motivation to say, I&#39;m going to stick to it.</font>	Transcription
1816.861	1827.06	<font color='navy'>And that all these people who are sitting up there, your big writers, and so on so forth? Every one of them has their anxieties about their status, right? Because even though you know, like you look</font>	Transcription
1827.061	1837.11	<font color='navy'>at me and say you published 10 books of poems, I say, Well, yeah. But I&#39;m looking at somebody else and I&#39;m thinking, gosh, now this guy has it made you know? Well it&#39;s all nonsense, right? Because the</font>	Transcription

1839.691	1851.3	<font color='navy'>So the key thing is then you focus on what you&#39;re doing, and what your work is doing and what it does about articulating your experience. But what you are doing about honing and disciplining yourself</font>	Transcription
1851.301	1855.89	<font color='navy'>in the craft, and making it happen, and to me that that becomes the most important thing.</font>	Transcription
