2.271605	4.627343	--m-a  G-r-a-h-a-m.
6.562413	13.20896	Marilyn Nelson. M-a-r-i-l-y-n  N-e-l-s-o-n.
15.564699	31.718332	Okay. Marilyn, let me ask you: you've lived in New England and Lower Connecticut, though you were not born there, you're Midwesterner by birth. How do you see that part of the country influencing your work?
32.727934	55.023313	Well, the last couple of writing projects I've done have been picking up stories from Connecticut history, actually, African American History in New England. I've just finished writing a long sequence of poems about an 18th century slave
55.023313	81.525368	who lived in a small city in Connecticut and who, when he died-- he was owned by a doctor, and when he died the doctor prepared his skeleton, and reassembled the bones and hung the skeleton in a room in his home, to be used as a teaching device. To teach people about skeletons, human bones.
81.525368	90.363151	And meanwhile this man, Fortune was his name, his wife and four children were still in this household.
90.359386	91.705522	And this is in Connecticut?
91.705522	99.10927	Yes, this is in Connecticut, just before the American Revolution. So that's one, that one's just come out. And--
99.10927	99.698205	What's the name?
99.698205	126.45266	It's called <i>Fortune's Bones</i>. And I have another project that's cooking on a back-burner now, about another man who was enslaved in the 18th century in Connecticut, and who managed to purchase his own freedom and then purchased all of the members of his family, and then several other people. And is kind of a local hero. He's very highly respected.
126.45266	140.082288	He died in about, oh, gosh, maybe 1790. Something like that. So I suppose what I'm doing is telling local history stories.
140.082288	158.84406	So the stories that you want people to know about that part of the country, but are about Black people in that part of the country, that are important for you? But you could you could write those stories in any part of the country, at least based on the local history of that part of the country, right?
158.84406	160.442596	Yes.
160.442596	168.351146	So in a sense, you're not-- you don't fall into the sense of place. You do have sense of place, but you have sense of history, which is probably--
168.351146	185.514381	Yes, I suppose what it is is sense of history. In the Fortune story, I was asked to write it by a local historical museum. But I would have written it if I had been living in Kansas.
183.915845	205.706423	Well there is some awfully cool history. That's right. I've noticed also that you have, I guess like many writers, moved to another genre. Your last book has been-- has won a Children's Book Award. Can you tell me a little bit about why that decision was made? And you see doing more in the children's literature genre?
205.706423	212.521237	It's not really a question of genre. It's a question of marketing. The poems have not changed.
209.828965	212.521237	[inaudible]
212.521237	232.460878	Yeah, yeah. I haven't, the poems, I'm still writing the same poems. I've I haven't changed my sense of audience at all. But I've-- for a couple of my books, I've moved to a different publisher. And the books are being marketed differently.
232.460878	261.31867	And I think of this in several ways. First of all, there's a very large market for young adult books, and there are not very many poets writing, publishing for that market. And secondly, I feel the-- giving young people real poems to read is a way of encouraging them to continue, to continue to be readers of poetry.
261.31867	281.763112	So I think I'm writing for future generations of poetry readers, helping to create future poetry readers. And I think that's about-- I think that's about all I can say about it. I really don't believe I've changed my writing at all.
281.763112	285.801521	Yeah. So you're-- a form, a different form in which you have placed it.
285.801521	287.568324	Yes, yes. Yes.
287.568324	289.335128	Well, it--
288.073125	292.616335	Ms. Maryemma, just a technical thing, just pull your blouse, so it's not just--
292.616335	294.383138	Down further, from the top.
293.121136	297.159544	Down further, from the top, yeah. It's just bunching down--
295.308607	299.515282	Ooh, yes. I can see it. Okay. Thank you for getting it.
295.813408	297.832612	There you go. There you go.
301.702753	334.935488	At Furious Flower, there's a lot of discussion about regenerating tradition. And I just heard you talk about putting the tradition of poetry writing back into the-- into the schools or giving children poetry from the ground up as it were. So, the notion of poetry as a tradition-- is it something you grew up with? Did you grow up reading poetry? Did you [inaudible] a lot of your family, did you learn poems that you had to say in church, or?
335.272022	365.391818	I didn't have to say, or I didn't learn poems for church, but I grew up in a family which read poetry. And I grew up encouraged to read and write poetry when-- I was one of these hypersensitive children. And I cried at the drop of a hat. Beautiful sunset, I would, would reduce me to tears. And my mother always told people don't worry about Marilyn, she's our poet. She's very sensitive, she's our poet. 
364.129815	365.391818	So they gave you that label. I see, okay, okay.
365.391818	392.819341	Yes, yes, yes. So that's my sense of tradition. But one of the things I have been struggling to do in the last few years is to return to some of the traditional forms of poetry. I mean, they're European forms, but they're traditions that for several generations of African Americans have inherited.
392.819341	418.564194	And so I've been writing in rhyme and meter again. And I think that's what-- I started doing it for many reasons. But one of the reasons was that I kept meeting people who would say, 'I used to like poetry, but I can't tell why poems are poems now. They seem like prose to me. Whatever happened to rhyme?'
418.143526	419.826196	So you're listening to your audience.
419.826196	422.770869	Yeah. I'm trying to, trying to.
422.770869	437.325965	We've been talking today a lot about why poets write and, that is, what are the factors that figure into the process, whether it's audience or whether it's the market, so clearly you are paying attention to audience.
437.325965	471.73657	To audience. It seems to me to be important to be writing for somebody. For people I-- when I was in my 20s, I had-- one of my great uncle's was the president of Kentucky State. And he was the patriarch of the family. And I used to send him poems and I sent him a batch of poems when I was in college, I think I was about a sophomore in college. And he wrote a very sweet letter back asking me why young poets nowadays don't write poems that people like me can understand. And I thought, well,
471.73657	489.74114	that's a really good question. Why shouldn't I be writing for someone? What kind of audience are we looking for, are we imagining if it's not this man? So I completely changed and started working hard on writing accessible poems.
489.74114	494.031949	Well, the first poetry that you were writing, though, was not in this vein.
494.031949	495.209818	No.
495.209818	512.036519	So were there influences that you were, you know, that you saw in that poetry where people whose work you respected-- was it the train-- the MFA program that sent you in that direction? What got you started in that line? And then, clearly, the shift occurs later. 
511.699985	537.360704	No, I don't have an MFA, I didn't go to a writing program. And I think it was just, I was an English major, and I was sitting in classes where we were analyzing things to death. And I was trying to write things that could be analyzed to death. And it took a while to realize that that's not necessary.
539.548176	541.399113	But the critics like that.
541.399113	542.072181	Yes!
542.072181	552.168201	Because you've got awards, you've got nominations for national book awards. So clearly that tradition of writing was successful for you, if you want to use the term success for that.
552.168201	575.809717	Although I hope that all of my published poems-- I mean this incident that I described happened before I was publishing, and I hope that the work I've published is accessible. I've really struggled with that, trying to reach out to an audience to tell my little truths to a big audience.
576.230384	600.965635	A loaded question: what is your sense of where Black poetry is today? I hear what you say about what you want to do in terms of audience. What's your sense of where we are today? Are we having a bigger impact? Are we-- do we have serious poets among us that we can look forward to another generation or so of poetry, or, just, how would you sum it up?
602.564172	635.62864	I'm not sure if I can sum it up because I don't have my finger on-- you'd have to have your finger on many pulses to be able to answer this question. One of the things that I think has happened is that we, as-- if there was a movement, the Black Arts Movement, for example, it's become fragmented. Because so many, so many young poets now are studying in MFA programs where there are only one or two African American students,
635.62864	651.025071	maybe one African American poet teaching them. So that we're divided, and a conference like Furious Flower is really important, because it brings people together, they're-- we need to have this kind of communication.
651.025071	677.695393	I've been very, very much moved by teaching in the Cave Canem program for that reason, because it brings people together. So we have a dialogue, we can discover what we have in common, we can work together in similar directions. I don't think we want to all be marching lockstep, but I think we can grow by exchanging ideas.
678.536728	691.409154	So the diffusion and dispersal effect, you think, has not necessarily been-- it may have provided good training for people but it may not have done a lot to nurture or, you know, a tradition of Black poetry writing.
691.409154	694.18556	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
693.165441	701.294841	That's interesting. I'm gonna have to stop. I'm enjoying this, and I want to keep going, but I have to stop.
702.903895	710.328677	Thank you. Oh, oh, if you just talk to each other, it's to get wide shots, for 30 seconds. Just talk, just say anything.
703.945047	704.996716	Thank you. Yeah, you too.
711.664296	715.197903	Well, I was just, I had all these other questions I wanted to ask but I don't want to ask them because she's gonna keep talking about them.
716.901607	718.184643	No, I know you have to run though.
718.184643	726.135259	I asked a question about genre. But is there another form that you, you know, are thinking of writing in?
726.030092	727.313128	Other than poetry, or what?
727.313128	745.002198	Well I mean, the poetry, as you say-- children's literature is another form, that's what I'm talking about-- genre. In that sense, I don't want to use the word genre, because of the way you explained it. But would you do, for instance, plays? Would you want to, you know, write-- because the poet, poetic voice can also be there. And so that other genre is--
745.002198	753.888799	I would like to, but I have a sister who writes plays and directs them. So I've been very careful not to step over into her territory.
752.45853	755.035118	Boundaries! Boundaries, boundaries.
755.035118	771.903886	Yes, yes. We did work together on a musical and with our brother who's a musician. She wrote the book. And she wrote some of the lyrics, and I wrote some of the lyrics and he did the music. But otherwise, I feel like I'll stay-- I'll respect our boundaries.
769.211614	771.903886	You'll stay where you are. Yeah. That's right, yeah.
772.261454	774.848559	That is the thing with sisters, you know, you do--
