15.564699	31.718332	<font color="#008080">Okay. Marilyn, let me ask you: you've lived in New England and Lower Connecticut, though you were not born there, you're Midwesterner by birth. How do you see that part of the country influencing your work?</font>	Transcription, Question
32.727934	55.023313	<font color="navy">Well, the last couple of writing projects I've done have been picking up stories from Connecticut history, actually, African American History in New England. I've just finished writing a long sequence of poems about an 18th century slave</font>	Transcription
55.023313	81.525368	<font color="navy">who lived in a small city in Connecticut and who, when he died-- he was owned by a doctor, and when he died the doctor prepared his skeleton, and reassembled the bones and hung the skeleton in a room in his home, to be used as a teaching device. To teach people about skeletons, human bones.</font>	Transcription
81.525368	90.363151	<font color="navy">And meanwhile this man, Fortune was his name, his wife and four children were still in this household.</font>	Transcription
90.359386	91.705522	<font color="#008080">And this is in Connecticut?</font>	Transcription
91.705522	99.10927	<font color="navy">Yes, this is in Connecticut, just before the American Revolution. So that's one, that one's just come out. And--</font>	Transcription
99.10927	99.698205	<font color="#008080">What's the name?</font>	Transcription
99.698205	126.45266	<font color="navy">It's called <i>Fortune's Bones</i>. And I have another project that's cooking on a back-burner now, about another man who was enslaved in the 18th century in Connecticut, and who managed to purchase his own freedom and then purchased all of the members of his family, and then several other people. And is kind of a local hero. He's very highly respected.</font>	Transcription
126.45266	140.082288	<font color="navy">He died in about, oh, gosh, maybe 1790. Something like that. So I suppose what I'm doing is telling local history stories.</font>	Transcription
140.082288	158.84406	<font color="#008080">So the stories that you want people to know about that part of the country, but are about Black people in that part of the country, that are important for you? But you could you could write those stories in any part of the country, at least based on the local history of that part of the country, right?</font>	Transcription, Question
158.84406	160.442596	<font color="navy">Yes.</font>	Transcription
160.442596	168.351146	<font color="#008080">So in a sense, you're not-- you don't fall into the sense of place. You do have sense of place, but you have sense of history, which is probably--</font>	Transcription
168.351146	185.514381	<font color="navy">Yes, I suppose what it is is sense of history. In the Fortune story, I was asked to write it by a local historical museum. But I would have written it if I had been living in Kansas.</font>	Transcription
183.915845	205.706423	<font color="#008080">Well there is some awfully cool history. That's right. I've noticed also that you have, I guess like many writers, moved to another genre. Your last book has been-- has won a Children's Book Award. Can you tell me a little bit about why that decision was made? And you see doing more in the children's literature genre?</font>	Transcription, Question
205.706423	212.521237	<font color="navy">It's not really a question of genre. It's a question of marketing. The poems have not changed.</font>	Transcription
209.828965	212.521237	<font color="#008080">[inaudible]</font>	Transcription
212.521237	232.460878	<font color="navy">Yeah, yeah. I haven't, the poems, I'm still writing the same poems. I've I haven't changed my sense of audience at all. But I've-- for a couple of my books, I've moved to a different publisher. And the books are being marketed differently.</font>	Transcription
232.460878	261.31867	<font color="navy">And I think of this in several ways. First of all, there's a very large market for young adult books, and there are not very many poets writing, publishing for that market. And secondly, I feel the-- giving young people real poems to read is a way of encouraging them to continue, to continue to be readers of poetry.</font>	Transcription
261.31867	281.763112	<font color="navy">So I think I'm writing for future generations of poetry readers, helping to create future poetry readers. And I think that's about-- I think that's about all I can say about it. I really don't believe I've changed my writing at all.</font>	Transcription
281.763112	285.801521	<font color="#008080">Yeah. So you're-- a form, a different form in which you have placed it.</font>	Transcription
285.801521	287.568324	<font color="navy">Yes, yes. Yes.</font>	Transcription
287.568324	289.335128	<font color="#008080">Well, it--</font>	Transcription
288.073125	292.616335	Ms. Maryemma, just a technical thing, just pull your blouse, so it's not just--	Transcription
292.616335	294.383138	Down further, from the top.	Transcription
293.121136	297.159544	Down further, from the top, yeah. It's just bunching down--	Transcription
295.308607	299.515282	<font color="#008080">Ooh, yes. I can see it. Okay. Thank you for getting it.</font>	Transcription
295.813408	297.832612	There you go. There you go.	Transcription
301.702753	334.935488	<font color="#008080">At Furious Flower, there's a lot of discussion about regenerating tradition. And I just heard you talk about putting the tradition of poetry writing back into the-- into the schools or giving children poetry from the ground up as it were. So, the notion of poetry as a tradition-- is it something you grew up with? Did you grow up reading poetry? Did you [inaudible] a lot of your family, did you learn poems that you had to say in church, or?</font>	Transcription, Question
335.272022	365.391818	<font color="navy">I didn't have to say, or I didn't learn poems for church, but I grew up in a family which read poetry. And I grew up encouraged to read and write poetry when-- I was one of these hypersensitive children. And I cried at the drop of a hat. Beautiful sunset, I would, would reduce me to tears. And my mother always told people don't worry about Marilyn, she's our poet. She's very sensitive, she's our poet. </font>	Transcription
364.129815	365.391818	<font color="#008080">So they gave you that label. I see, okay, okay.</font>	Transcription
365.391818	392.819341	<font color="navy">Yes, yes, yes. So that's my sense of tradition. But one of the things I have been struggling to do in the last few years is to return to some of the traditional forms of poetry. I mean, they're European forms, but they're traditions that for several generations of African Americans have inherited.</font>	Transcription
392.819341	418.564194	<font color="navy">And so I've been writing in rhyme and meter again. And I think that's what-- I started doing it for many reasons. But one of the reasons was that I kept meeting people who would say, 'I used to like poetry, but I can't tell why poems are poems now. They seem like prose to me. Whatever happened to rhyme?'</font>	Transcription
418.143526	419.826196	<font color="#008080">So you're listening to your audience.</font>	Transcription
419.826196	422.770869	<font color="navy">Yeah. I'm trying to, trying to.</font>	Transcription
422.770869	437.325965	<font color="#008080">We've been talking today a lot about why poets write and, that is, what are the factors that figure into the process, whether it's audience or whether it's the market, so clearly you are paying attention to audience.</font>	Transcription
437.325965	471.73657	<font color="navy">To audience. It seems to me to be important to be writing for somebody. For people I-- when I was in my 20s, I had-- one of my great uncle's was the president of Kentucky State. And he was the patriarch of the family. And I used to send him poems and I sent him a batch of poems when I was in college, I think I was about a sophomore in college. And he wrote a very sweet letter back asking me why young poets nowadays don't write poems that people like me can understand. And I thought, well,</font>	Transcription
471.73657	489.74114	<font color="navy">that's a really good question. Why shouldn't I be writing for someone? What kind of audience are we looking for, are we imagining if it's not this man? So I completely changed and started working hard on writing accessible poems.</font>	Transcription
489.74114	494.031949	<font color="#008080">Well, the first poetry that you were writing, though, was not in this vein.</font>	Transcription
494.031949	495.209818	<font color="navy">No.</font>	Transcription
495.209818	512.036519	<font color="#008080">So were there influences that you were, you know, that you saw in that poetry where people whose work you respected-- was it the train-- the MFA program that sent you in that direction? What got you started in that line? And then, clearly, the shift occurs later. </font>	Transcription, Question
511.699985	537.360704	<font color="navy">No, I don't have an MFA, I didn't go to a writing program. And I think it was just, I was an English major, and I was sitting in classes where we were analyzing things to death. And I was trying to write things that could be analyzed to death. And it took a while to realize that that's not necessary.</font>	Transcription
539.548176	541.399113	<font color="#008080">But the critics like that.</font>	Transcription
541.399113	542.072181	<font color="navy">Yes!</font>	Transcription
542.072181	552.168201	<font color="#008080">Because you've got awards, you've got nominations for national book awards. So clearly that tradition of writing was successful for you, if you want to use the term success for that.</font>	Transcription
552.168201	575.809717	<font color="navy">Although I hope that all of my published poems-- I mean this incident that I described happened before I was publishing, and I hope that the work I've published is accessible. I've really struggled with that, trying to reach out to an audience to tell my little truths to a big audience.</font>	Transcription
576.230384	600.965635	<font color="#008080">A loaded question: what is your sense of where Black poetry is today? I hear what you say about what you want to do in terms of audience. What's your sense of where we are today? Are we having a bigger impact? Are we-- do we have serious poets among us that we can look forward to another generation or so of poetry, or, just, how would you sum it up?</font>	Transcription, Question
602.564172	635.62864	<font color="navy">I'm not sure if I can sum it up because I don't have my finger on-- you'd have to have your finger on many pulses to be able to answer this question. One of the things that I think has happened is that we, as-- if there was a movement, the Black Arts Movement, for example, it's become fragmented. Because so many, so many young poets now are studying in MFA programs where there are only one or two African American students,</font>	Transcription
635.62864	651.025071	<font color="navy">maybe one African American poet teaching them. So that we're divided, and a conference like Furious Flower is really important, because it brings people together, they're-- we need to have this kind of communication.</font>	Transcription
651.025071	677.695393	<font color="navy">I've been very, very much moved by teaching in the Cave Canem program for that reason, because it brings people together. So we have a dialogue, we can discover what we have in common, we can work together in similar directions. I don't think we want to all be marching lockstep, but I think we can grow by exchanging ideas.</font>	Transcription
678.536728	691.409154	<font color="#008080">So the diffusion and dispersal effect, you think, has not necessarily been-- it may have provided good training for people but it may not have done a lot to nurture or, you know, a tradition of Black poetry writing.</font>	Transcription
691.409154	694.18556	<font color="navy">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>	Transcription
693.165441	701.294841	<font color="#008080">That's interesting. I'm gonna have to stop. I'm enjoying this, and I want to keep going, but I have to stop.</font>	Transcription
702.903895	710.328677	Thank you. Oh, oh, if you just talk to each other, it's to get wide shots, for 30 seconds. Just talk, just say anything.	Transcription
703.945047	704.996716	<font color="navy">Thank you. Yeah, you too.</font>	Transcription
711.664296	715.197903	<font color="#008080">Well, I was just, I had all these other questions I wanted to ask but I don't want to ask them because she's gonna keep talking about them.</font>	Transcription
716.901607	718.184643	<font color="navy">No, I know you have to run though.</font>	Transcription
718.184643	726.135259	<font color="#008080">I asked a question about genre. But is there another form that you, you know, are thinking of writing in?</font>	Transcription, Question
726.030092	727.313128	<font color="navy">Other than poetry, or what?</font>	Transcription
727.313128	745.002198	<font color="#008080">Well I mean, the poetry, as you say-- children's literature is another form, that's what I'm talking about-- genre. In that sense, I don't want to use the word genre, because of the way you explained it. But would you do, for instance, plays? Would you want to, you know, write-- because the poet, poetic voice can also be there. And so that other genre is--</font>	Transcription, Question
745.002198	753.888799	<font color="navy">I would like to, but I have a sister who writes plays and directs them. So I've been very careful not to step over into her territory.</font>	Transcription
752.45853	755.035118	<font color="#008080">Boundaries! Boundaries, boundaries.</font>	Transcription
755.035118	771.903886	<font color="navy">Yes, yes. We did work together on a musical and with our brother who's a musician. She wrote the book. And she wrote some of the lyrics, and I wrote some of the lyrics and he did the music. But otherwise, I feel like I'll stay-- I'll respect our boundaries.</font>	Transcription
769.211614	771.903886	<font color="#008080">You'll stay where you are. Yeah. That's right, yeah.</font>	Transcription
772.261454	774.848559	That is the thing with sisters, you know, you do--	Transcription
