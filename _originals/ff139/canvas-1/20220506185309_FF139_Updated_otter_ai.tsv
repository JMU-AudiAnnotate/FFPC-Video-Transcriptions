230.501	232.39	<font color='navy'>the books are being marketed differently.</font>	Transcription
232.721	250.69	<font color='navy'>And I think of this in several ways. First of all, there&#39;s a very large market for young adult books, and there are not very many poets writing, publishing for that market. And secondly, I feel the--</font>	Transcription
252.401	261.28	<font color='navy'>giving young people real poems to read is a way of encouraging them to continue, to continue to be readers of poetry.</font>	Transcription

302.511	317.21	<font color='#008080'>At Furious Flower, there&#39;s a lot of discussion about regenerating tradition. And I just heard you talk about putting the tradition of poetry writing back into the-- into the schools or giving children</font>	Transcription
317.211	332.57	<font color='#008080'>poetry from the ground up as it were. So, the notion of poetry as a tradition-- is it something you grew up with? Did you grow up reading poetry? Did you [inaudible] a lot of your family, did you</font>	Transcription
332.571	335.0	<font color='#008080'>learn poems that you had to say in church, or?</font>	Transcription
335.63	349.19	<font color='navy'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
335.631	349.19	<font color='navy'>I didn&#39;t have to say, or I didn&#39;t learn poems for church, but I grew up in a family which read poetry. And I grew up encouraged to read and write poetry when-- I was one of these</font>	Transcription
349.221	364.07	<font color='navy'>hypersensitive children. And I cried at the drop of a hat. Beautiful sunset, I would, would reduce me to tears. And my mother always told people don&#39;t worry about Marilyn, she&#39;s our poet. She&#39;s very</font>	Transcription
364.071	365.18	<font color='navy'>sensitive, she&#39;s our poet.</font>	Transcription

366.0	382.38	<font color='navy'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
366.001	382.38	<font color='navy'>Yes, yes, yes. So that&#39;s my sense of tradition. But one of the things I have been struggling to do in the last few years is to return to some of the traditional forms of poetry. I</font>	Transcription
382.381	392.79	<font color='navy'>mean, they&#39;re European forms, but they&#39;re traditions that for several generations of African Americans have inherited.</font>	Transcription
393.091	408.48	<font color='navy'>And so I&#39;ve been writing in rhyme and meter again. And I think that&#39;s what-- I started doing it for many reasons. But one of the reasons was that I kept meeting people who would say, &quot;I used to like</font>	Transcription
408.481	418.41	<font color='navy'>poetry, but I can&#39;t tell why poems are poems now. They seem like prose to me. Whatever happened to rhyme?&quot;</font>	Transcription
418.411	419.76	<font color='navy'>So you&#39;re listening to your audience.</font>	Transcription
419.821	422.73	<font color='navy'>Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m trying to, trying to.</font>	Transcription

422.851	435.66	<font color='#008080'>We&#39;ve been talking today a lot about why poets write and, that is, what are the factors that figure into the process, whether it&#39;s audience or whether it&#39;s the market, so clearly you</font>	Transcription
435.661	436.92	<font color='#008080'>are paying attention to audience.</font>	Transcription
437.32	451.42	<font color='navy'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
437.321	451.42	<font color='navy'>To audience. It seems to me to be important to be writing for somebody. For people I-- when I was in my 20s, I had-- one of my great uncle&#39;s was the president of Kentucky State. And he</font>	Transcription
451.421	463.33	<font color='navy'>was the patriarch of the family. And I used to send him poems and I sent him a batch of poems when I was in college, I think I was about a sophomore in college. And he wrote a very sweet letter back</font>	Transcription
463.331	471.22	<font color='navy'>asking me why young poets nowadays don&#39;t write poems that people like me can understand. And I thought,</font>	Transcription
472.331	488.17	<font color='navy'>that&#39;s a really good question. Why shouldn&#39;t I be writing for someone? What kind of audience are we looking for, are we imagining if it&#39;s not this man? So I completely changed and started working hard</font>	Transcription
488.171	489.82	<font color='navy'>on writing accessible poems.</font>	Transcription
489.87	494.16	<font color='#008080'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
489.871	494.16	<font color='#008080'>Well, the first poetry that you were writing, though, was not in this vein.</font>	Transcription

507.421	511.53	<font color='#008080'>direction? What got you started in that line? And then, clearly, the shift occurs later.</font>	Transcription
511.89	522.84	<font color='navy'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
511.891	522.84	<font color='navy'>No, I don&#39;t have an MFA, I didn&#39;t go to a writing program. And I think it was just, I was an English major,</font>	Transcription

522.841	523.38	<font color='#008080'>Yeah. And we do teach English [inaudible].</font>	Transcription
523.38	536.49	<font color='navy'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
523.381	536.49	<font color='navy'>and I was sitting in classes where we were analyzing things to death. And I was trying to write things that could be analyzed to death. And it took a while to realize that that&#39;s not</font>	Transcription
536.491	537.33	<font color='navy'>necessary.</font>	Transcription
539.58	550.23	<font color='#008080'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
539.581	550.23	<font color='#008080'>But the critics like that, because you&#39;ve got awards, you&#39;ve got nominations for national book awards. So clearly that tradition of writing was successful for you, if you want to use</font>	Transcription

576.541	589.65	<font color='#008080'>A loaded question: what is your sense of where Black poetry is today? I hear what you say about what you want to do in terms of audience. What&#39;s your sense of where we are today? Are</font>	Transcription
589.651	600.66	<font color='#008080'>we having a bigger impact? Are we-- do we have serious poets among us that we can look forward to another generation or so poetry, or, just how would you sum it up?</font>	Transcription
602.88	613.74	<font color='navy'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
602.881	613.74	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m not sure if I can sum it up because I don&#39;t have my finger on-- you&#39;d have to have your finger on many pulses to be able to answer this question. One of the things that I think has</font>	Transcription
613.741	632.49	<font color='navy'>happened is that we, as-- if there was a movement, the Black Arts Movement, for example, it&#39;s become fragmented. Because so many, so many young poets now are studying in MFA programs where there are</font>	Transcription
632.491	635.43	<font color='navy'>only one or two African American students,</font>	Transcription
635.941	649.8	<font color='navy'>maybe one African American poet teaching them. So that we&#39;re divided, and a conference like Furious Flower is really important, because it brings people together, they&#39;re-- we need to have this kind</font>	Transcription
649.801	651.03	<font color='navy'>of communication.</font>	Transcription
651.031	665.79	<font color='navy'>I&#39;ve been very, very much moved by teaching in the Cave Canem program for that reason, because it brings people together. So we have a dialogue, we can discover what we have in common, we can work</font>	Transcription
666.001	677.82	<font color='navy'>together in similar directions. I don&#39;t think we want to all be marching lockstep, but I think we can grow by exchanging ideas.</font>	Transcription
