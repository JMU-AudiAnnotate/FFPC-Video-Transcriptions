9.001	25.92	<font color='sienna'>About her rather. Witnessing the vernacular project Alma said into the microphone, &#39;The Black Back-ups,&#39; by Kate Rushin. She stepped around the table, a stack of photocopies held lightly in her arm</font>	Transcription
25.921	38.7	<font color='sienna'>and smiling now, she divided the pile among several people sitting in the first row of chairs in the small lecture hall, indicating that each should take a copy and pass the rest on. Had project</font>	Transcription
38.731	51.18	<font color='sienna'>sounded a little pretentious, she wondered. She had rejected aspects of the vernacular as conventional beyond bearing. &#39;Two white boy,&#39; Thelma had called it and vernacular element elements that</font>	Transcription
51.181	63.18	<font color='sienna'>sounded well, too elementary, especially before this audience of literary scholars. There had been no cries of outrage when she announced her title of course, Alma had the grace to laugh at herself,</font>	Transcription
63.511	74.46	<font color='sienna'>but she observed silently there had been no other reactions either. She resumed her seat behind the table with the other panelists, folded her hands a topic and looked out at the audience saying</font>	Transcription
74.461	86.91	<font color='sienna'>nothing. It wasn&#39;t unheard of for historians to talk about poetry and culture. Though Alma admitted they usually did so uninvited by literary scholars, who seemed at this blush anyway, to be less</font>	Transcription
86.911	100.44	<font color='sienna'>territorial than historians, which Alma was and apparently better known than she thought, or philosophers for that matter. Still, the invitation to talk about the vernacular, common everyday speech</font>	Transcription
100.591	113.43	<font color='sienna'>and Afro-American culture at a national conference on Afro-American poetry had come as a surprise to her. She was a Victorianist by training and Afro-Americanist almost by default. Of course, much of</font>	Transcription
113.431	126.27	<font color='sienna'>her work on the Diaspora was drawn from unwritten sources, oral tellings of a so-called vernacular source, her lips twisted wryly, vernacular was from the Latin word <i>vernaculus</i>, meaning</font>	Transcription
126.451	138.78	<font color='sienna'>&#39;domestic&#39; according to Web Webster, its root word, <i>verna</i> meant &#39;home-born slave&#39;. The African sources of her work were not from slaves, their language was not common or every-day, though it</font>	Transcription
138.781	150.84	<font color='sienna'>was spoken and in some cases never written down until she transcribed it. Only wealthy Africans or those otherwise renowned were named in the accounts passed on by word-of-mouth and retold and sung in</font>	Transcription
150.871	162.0	<font color='sienna'>each generation. Oral culture would always come out on the short end of the stick when pitted against written records, Alma thought glumly. It was only a poem because it was written. If it didn&#39;t work</font>	Transcription
162.001	174.15	<font color='sienna'>on the page, it didn&#39;t work at all, if it could not be recorded, it didn&#39;t exist beyond the moment. The only thing Alma thought again, that had saved negros from extinction was radio and records,</font>	Transcription
174.481	185.16	<font color='sienna'>which would also be the instrument of our destruction, for hadn&#39;t records especially laid bare the very heart of the culture for every enterprising white boy in the world to bleed. &#39;Negro&#39; was the</font>	Transcription
185.161	197.82	<font color='sienna'>common everyday speech of America, and any poetry that called itself African American couldn&#39;t help but be steeped in it. Vernacular in that old sense, was an apt description of New World Africans,</font>	Transcription
198.121	210.99	<font color='sienna'>those Afro-Brazilians and Afro-Cubans, Afro Americans descended from the kidnapped and enslaved <i>verna</i>, home-born slave. And thus the continuing binary between slave and master seemed to make</font>	Transcription
211.021	222.75	<font color='sienna'>little difference that they were also descended from the slave owners too as well as the slave by culture, if not by actual blood. Her history, the very intellectual tradition in which she labored</font>	Transcription
222.961	235.59	<font color='sienna'>always came back to slavery. And historian though she was, Alma was tired of slavery. Took too much time in the conversation to review the century-old horrors but one could not assume that everyone</font>	Transcription
235.591	248.49	<font color='sienna'>knew them or understood that slavery affected people&#39;s lives long after its abolition. Thank goodness this audience would know all that. Still, no one in it had yet spoken. Alma looked down at the</font>	Transcription
248.491	261.87	<font color='sienna'>paper before her. Kate Rushin, &#39;The Black Back-ups.&#39; This is dedicated to Mary Clayton, Cissy Houston and was caught as she had been on first reading by Clayton&#39;s name hearing that powerful alto</font>	Transcription
261.871	280.44	<font color='sienna'>bellowing got a case of the steam ro-o-o-o-ola. The word drawn out in the voice fading to silence. Tap, tap, a cowbell beaten by a drumstick. Three, four alone off-mic male voice blues. Alma tore her</font>	Transcription
280.441	292.08	<font color='sienna'>eyes away lest she be drawn completely into the world of the poem. Neither project nor element seemed an adequate description of the wild invention and fusion that seemed renewed and expanded in each</font>	Transcription
292.081	306.45	<font color='sienna'>reading of the poem. No, Alma told herself now. Project was both mask on image and buzzword and she could not but be pleased with her title. If she let it, the names in the poem would draw her on as</font>	Transcription
306.451	318.78	<font color='sienna'>they must now be drawing the audience past the dedication into narrative plaints so widely voiced it was now almost formula. Bump up against old ironies cast in a new light, half forgotten memories</font>	Transcription
318.781	331.05	<font color='sienna'>reveal now as rites of passage phrases playfully turned and twisted. The reader made into part of the chorus. Not the doo-wop girls, the white boys rave about but the girls who sang back-up on there</font>	Transcription
331.051	343.86	<font color='sienna'>is something on your mind the parody, doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo. Yes, Alma told herself. Even nodded a little. There would be plenty of discussion when they finished reading. Smile,</font>	Transcription
343.891	345.87	<font color='sienna'>smiling slightly, she leaned forward.</font>	Transcription
347.311	357.06	<font color='sienna'>Thelma had actually thought she was doing Alma a favor when she&#39;d suggested Alma&#39;s name for this panel. Thelma wrote about the broad range of black woman&#39;s literature, though in recent years, she had</font>	Transcription
357.061	367.23	<font color='sienna'>focused her attention on the rich turn-of-the-century period, and the first literary outpourings of the free people. Alma had some interest in the period, had met Thelma at a couple of conferences and</font>	Transcription
367.231	379.92	<font color='sienna'>been drawn by the sharp womanist analysis the sister brought to every discussion. Alma had temporized about the invitation. She read some poetry, of course and fiction, but to talk about either one to</font>	Transcription
379.921	391.77	<font color='sienna'>an audience of people who talked and wrote about them for a living, held no appeal to her. She would check her schedule, she told the voice on the phone, get back to them. She called Thelma. Just talk</font>	Transcription
391.771	404.19	<font color='sienna'>about what you know, Thelma said non-literary sources of cultural documentation and occupa- and academic scholarship sounded dull as dust at a poetry conference, Alma objected. Then just do a</font>	Transcription
404.191	415.74	<font color='sienna'>conventional history. After all, history is your thing, outlining uses of the vernacular and literary poetry, a development with which Alma was at least somewhat familiar, identifying vernacular</font>	Transcription
415.741	428.46	<font color='sienna'>idioms and literate sources was a way of documenting traditionalist sentiment otherwise unrecorded among pre-literate peoples, And Alma had began her research with Lucy Terry Prince. Eunice Allen see</font>	Transcription
428.461	440.7	<font color='sienna'>the Indians coming and hope to save herself by running and had not her petticoat stopped her. The awful creatures have not caught her and Tommy hocked her on the ground for dead. Alma&#39;s lips quirked</font>	Transcription
440.701	452.31	<font color='sienna'>at the grim humour of the remembered lines, but it taken a graduate student to make her see that humor in the rough rhythms of Terry&#39;s lines. Her notes highlighted Paul Laurence Dunbar&#39;s contributions</font>	Transcription
452.491	465.93	<font color='sienna'>in removing as his contemporary James Weldon Johnson had said much of the course negro-ness from the so-called nigra dialect coined by whites at the turn of the century. And she contrasted him with</font>	Transcription
465.931	483.42	<font color='sienna'>his contemporary, James Weldon Johnson, who had taken the process even further. Preparing a field for the authentic dictions of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown and so on and so forth. Even now,</font>	Transcription
483.451	495.42	<font color='sienna'>Alma was a little saddened by the musical about Paul Laurence Dunbar and James Weldon Johnson&#39;s the time that each of these had spent on Broadway that had never been written, would probably never be,</font>	Transcription
495.421	509.04	<font color='sienna'>at least in her lifetime written, nor would the tragedy of split literary persona of their split of the split literary persona, that neither they nor their lineal descendant Sterling Brown had ever</font>	Transcription
509.041	521.31	<font color='sienna'>overcome. One voice to speak for the people, the folk who can&#39;t make the book talk for themselves. Another standard voice to speak for the low college educated me. She would never see a performance of</font>	Transcription
521.341	532.86	<font color='sienna'>asking mama or the animated feature that should have been made from montage on a dream deferred. Alma lamented and play the blues while she read, took notes, wrote, but convention hadn&#39;t worked. Not</font>	Transcription
532.861	545.01	<font color='sienna'>even when she fell back on style. The kind of anecdotal irreverent chitchat she and Thelma often shared about the period. Papers rustled in the audience. A chair scraped. Alma looked out at out at the</font>	Transcription
545.011	557.1	<font color='sienna'>people. Maybe that was what they came for convention, what she should have given them. But she hadn&#39;t found the words for even that. You could talk about violence&#39;s vernacular Pearl had said when Alma</font>	Transcription
557.101	568.8	<font color='sienna'>consulted her Pearl was a writer, novelist, little known and journalist. She actually earned a close but stable living from the reams of opinions, interviews, features and ghosted speeches that</font>	Transcription
568.801	582.75	<font color='sienna'>streamed from her printer. Pearl made Alma listen to Baraka&#39;s poem from my father-in-law, but just the mention of Amiri Baraka&#39;s name, aka Leroy Jones, made Alma uneasy. Baraka was part of the madness</font>	Transcription
582.751	594.78	<font color='sienna'>of the 70s coined traditions and a violent and vicious chauvinism. She said none of this allowed, of course, time was too short to be getting into an argument with Pearl. Besides, and this she had</font>	Transcription
594.781	606.99	<font color='sienna'>said aloud, Leroy did his best work in the post-Beat period, the late 50s and early 60s. It&#39;s the politics, isn&#39;t it, his radical Marxism. Pearl had taunted and shoved a book open to the Crow Jane</font>	Transcription
606.991	620.67	<font color='sienna'>series under Alma&#39;s nose. Stung, Alma retorted more like sexual gluttony and narcissism. Pearl had backed off then or talk about jazz as both vernacular and haute couture. She&#39;d offered in compromise,</font>	Transcription
620.821	634.02	<font color='sienna'>and referred Alma to Michael Harper and Yusef Komunyakaa. But Alma found a way to say what interested her about their poems, let alone what might interest a roomful of literary critics. Alma tuned</font>	Transcription
634.021	635.13	<font color='sienna'>into spoken word.</font>	Transcription
637.611	651.71	<font color='sienna'>And saw even the and saw how even the best especially the best of these poets were seduced into stand-up or sing silently for whatever reason, on sight. She tried to listen to rap, but it made her</font>	Transcription
651.711	664.1	<font color='sienna'>feel too white. Hip hop was no substitute for song. What little she understood of the lyrics of hardcore, offended and repelled her. She refused to return to the blues as a matter of principle. She</font>	Transcription
664.101	675.17	<font color='sienna'>had never gone with a man who wore hydrate pants, nor worked in a house of the rising sun. And while she often admired this one&#39;s technique, or that one&#39;s artistry, she didn&#39;t believe that anyone who</font>	Transcription
675.171	686.99	<font color='sienna'>now saying of having done so, had ever, ever had either, no matter how well they reproduced blues form. Rap was the only form to evolve from contemporary circumstances. But the circumstances of which</font>	Transcription
686.991	700.07	<font color='sienna'>they spoke were not hers. She watched videos and went to galleries and clubs, deciding that what we mean when we said vernacular, was really what we mean when we said Black. The truth was that all of</font>	Transcription
700.191	711.68	<font color='sienna'>it--spoken word, hardcore, hip hop, performance, installation, whatever--spoke to her but did not move her to speak, or at least to write the little occasional paper she had expected to produce.</font>	Transcription
713.271	727.25	<font color='sienna'>Horace sent her a copy of the jazz poetry anthology, and she had seen in its title a fusion of low, that is, vernacular of slaves, for jazz was certainly that and high culture, and the so-called high</font>	Transcription
727.251	739.52	<font color='sienna'>culture in less than a century in American life. She found in Rushin&#39;s poem the need for a word other than vernacular to describe the fusion, she read there. Freedom came out of crossbreeding between</font>	Transcription
739.521	751.4	<font color='sienna'>master and slave, a kind of freedom at least, if the scatting meant anything in the poem, she thought, and she couldn&#39;t be sure of that until she heard the poem performed, it invited you to see that</font>	Transcription
751.461	764.57	<font color='sienna'>classless, castless and egalitarian society freedom or did it just mean that these were so much false hope. Beside her, the previous speaker coughed nervously into his cupped hand. Alma turned an</font>	Transcription
764.571	777.68	<font color='sienna'>inquiring face to the panel moderator who was staring at her. She turned back to the audience and waited. Is that it? An incredulous make voice called from the back of the room. Sir, did you read the</font>	Transcription
777.681	790.85	<font color='sienna'>poem? she asked politely. There was some muffled laughter papers rustled softly and still as people began to read the two pages she&#39;d handed out and Alma looked at the narrator expectantly. He nodded</font>	Transcription
790.851	806.15	<font color='sienna'>and smiled encouragingly. She leaned forward into her microphone, The End. The moderator stared at her again, Well, you can at least read the poem. He seems she noted rather peeved, which rather</font>	Transcription
806.151	821.06	<font color='sienna'>peeved her as her&#39;s was the only presentation that seemed likely to stay within the strict time limits that every that every other panelists had casually flounted. Once again, Alma stood behind the</font>	Transcription

1368.901	1396.62	<font color='darkcyan'>studied or what ever. But it is the whole event, to me, is a performance event. And the poet is most successful when his voice is performed, by himself by others, in a concert hall in a classroom, the</font>	Transcription

1432.861	1442.16	<font color='NONE'>My questions are for Mr. Aubert. Earlier, you made a distinction between folk and popular. But you didn&#39;t elaborate. And I wasn&#39;t totally familiar with the distinction you were</font>	Transcription
1442.161	1452.96	<font color='NONE'>making. I was wondering if you could speak on that. And also was wondering if the use of black cultural products as commodities in our in our capitalist economy has anything to do with the transition</font>	Transcription
1452.961	1460.28	<font color='NONE'>from folk to popular, and I don&#39;t know how familiar you are with rap, but if you could comment on whether or not you feel rap has made that that switch.</font>	Transcription

1461.781	1478.46	<font color='#008080'>Um, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m prepared. The reason why I brought up the topic of the distinction between the folk and pop is because I wasn&#39;t prepared to talk about it. And I wanted to just</font>	Transcription
1478.461	1490.97	<font color='#008080'>simply want to raise it as a possibility for young people who want to look into this and such as yourself, you see, but it does seem to me that when you go from the folk to the popular, you do move</font>	Transcription
1490.971	1501.17	<font color='#008080'>into commodification more. You see, even though I mentioned the Golden Gate Quartet, how many of you know the Golden Gate Quartet, you know, and I listened to the Golden Gate Quartet, those old</font>	Transcription
1501.171	1516.68	<font color='#008080'>recordings and I hear rap. You know, we&#39;re rapping way back in the 40s and 50s. And what have you, their records sold, but they weren&#39;t as commodified as people are today. So I still sort of think of</font>	Transcription
1516.681	1527.18	<font color='#008080'>them as in the, in the, in the realm of the folk, although I don&#39;t want to get into dichotomizations either. Because I think things should go together rather than be, rather than be separated. So I</font>	Transcription
1527.181	1534.14	<font color='#008080'>would like to find instead to discover that there&#39;s a conflation, perhaps of the, of the folk and the popular.</font>	Transcription
1534.32	1535.55	<font color='NONE'><b>Unknown Speaker</b></font>	Speaker
1534.321	1535.55	<font color='NONE'>So it&#39;s like a spectrum?</font>	Transcription

1536.181	1546.14	<font color='#008080'>And but inevitably, we have to deal with spectra with spectrum. Yes, I think that there may be a spectrum. But and then a spectrum, of course, doesn&#39;t dichotomize it says you&#39;re either</font>	Transcription
1546.321	1562.31	<font color='#008080'>closer to the center close to that end. And somewhere along somewhere along the spectrum. Yeah. But I just posit that as an area of investigation for for some young scholars who may be present at that</font>	Transcription
1562.371	1579.2	<font color='#008080'>moment, especially, yeah. But I think that things have to be integrated in art. I&#39;m not fully given over to the idea that poetry is just for performance, I will never be given a because there are</font>	Transcription
1579.201	1593.87	<font color='#008080'>people who want to sit by the fire side and read a book. So the portrait has to be to me to be written in such a way as to be able to perform itself on the page, as well as orally in an auditorium. I</font>	Transcription
1593.871	1606.26	<font color='#008080'>think it should do both. And I think Don, Don Lee at the time now Haki Madhubuti was moving in that direction. When he put out his book, I will We will Walk the Way of the New World. And I saw some</font>	Transcription
1606.261	1620.03	<font color='#008080'>great potential in that book for development along that line. But then Haki stopped writing poetry. He started writing aphorisms, you see, but I can understand that too, because he&#39;s an activist. And</font>	Transcription
1620.031	1634.67	<font color='#008080'>his vision of accomplishment was was a tremendous one and is a tremendous one which he continues continues to pursue in Chicago with his publishing house. And his his school, you know, that he and his</font>	Transcription

1674.541	1686.36	<font color='teal'>about, and how it&#39;s meant to be read, in the oral tradition. I&#39;m wondering, I&#39;ve heard a lot of different people read a lot of different poems: the author, him or herself, and then other poets or</font>	Transcription
1686.361	1696.59	<font color='teal'>other people. And I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a danger at all, in doing that, because every time the poem is, is read by different people, it sounds different all of the time. And I get different things</font>	Transcription
1696.591	1707.51	<font color='teal'>out of the poem. And I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s ever a danger in performance, when it&#39;s not done by the author themselves of it being misconstrued, or the aesthetics and what the author or poet was</font>	Transcription

1726.111	1739.34	<font color='sienna'>that danger is there, whether the poem is actually read, or whether it is being, you know, performed by somebody else other than the author. And to me, in a way, it is, in fact, a kind of, let me say</font>	Transcription
1739.341	1752.81	<font color='sienna'>two things: In a way, it&#39;s like the mark of a great work of art that, in fact, you get multiple and variable kinds of meanings out of it, it shouldn&#39;t mean that exactly the same thing every single</font>	Transcription
1752.991	1769.52	<font color='sienna'>time. That&#39;s not art that&#39;s repetition. And, and that&#39;s rote, and at the same time, I do think that it&#39;s a good thing that somebody else performs the poem, and does it in a different way and is able</font>	Transcription
1769.521	1778.88	<font color='sienna'>to see and to bring forth to evoke different kinds of nuances. I think that that&#39;s all a part of what the artistic spirit experience itself is supposed to be.</font>	Transcription

1847.971	1858.92	<font color='sienna'>That&#39;s one of the reasons I say, I&#39;m very glad that these are going to be published because I think that that&#39;s, in fact, exactly what Eleanor Traylor&#39;s paper was talking about</font>	Transcription
1859.281	1871.88	<font color='sienna'>the fact that when we so very often, when we talk about the vernacular, or we talk about popular culture, we talk about folk or whatever the oral culture, we tend to leave out the spiritual aspect of</font>	Transcription
1871.881	1885.56	<font color='sienna'>it, when in fact, it is the spiritual that is, you know, kind of like the root of all of that, at least in terms of historical discovery. So that it&#39;s there. Literary people or academic people, for</font>	Transcription
1885.561	1903.56	<font color='sienna'>whatever reason, tend to ignore it. And in some ways, that&#39;s a bad thing, because it gives a kind of skewed aspect to the culture. We, as far as anybody outside of the culture knows, we are a totally,</font>	Transcription
1903.891	1916.16	<font color='sienna'>almost a completely secular people. And that whatever, you know, our spiritual life is, it doesn&#39;t have any bearing on the quote unquote, culture we create, which is how you can get into calling some</font>	Transcription
1916.161	1928.85	<font color='sienna'>of these calling a lot of things that that are questionable, or at least controversial, as far as culture is concerned, calling a culture, right, but it&#39;s there for the people inside of the culture</font>	Transcription
1928.851	1941.18	<font color='sienna'>itself. I mean, it becomes almost like all something secret and hidden. And because it is secret, and hidden, it&#39;s not as open to exploitation, and misuse in the way that other aspects of the culture</font>	Transcription
1941.181	1956.6	<font color='sienna'>have become a kind of like the common property of everybody, of everybody in America. Some of that may be breaking down now, because more people inside of the culture inside of the field, are saying</font>	Transcription
1956.601	1970.76	<font color='sienna'>to themselves, or asking themselves, why is it that I am, you know, calling the the real, the authentic, only what happens out in the street, when, in fact, black people live in exist and work and</font>	Transcription
1970.761	1981.11	<font color='sienna'>create all over and that we have always created within the church. And what we&#39;ve done is, you know, really helped to change what the definition of church and what the definition of religion, what the</font>	Transcription
1981.111	1992.36	<font color='sienna'>definition of spiritual is, in the same the way that what we have done has helped to change what is the definition of poetry? What is the definition of high and low culture and everything else about</font>	Transcription
1992.391	2005.41	<font color='sienna'>American life? So I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s there. And certainly it&#39;s here on this panel it just hasnt gotten the kind of scholarly attention that other aspects of the culture have gotten.</font>	Transcription

2005.001	2020.81	<font color='indigo'>I would disagree with that a little bit. But I think it&#39;s maybe just a matter of perspective. But um, I don&#39;t know, my my sense of things is that actually, that the sacred is</font>	Transcription
2020.901	2034.13	<font color='indigo'>over-emphasized in the way that black people are portrayed in the media at large. Our leadership, I think, is presented as being almost exclusively sacred, or from the church in, in, in one way or</font>	Transcription
2034.131	2046.79	<font color='indigo'>another. It seems like that sometimes, I mean, I think of you know, Bill Clinton just loves when black church people sing, you know, you need when you when you think about what, what literally does,</font>	Transcription
2046.791	2061.61	<font color='indigo'>what are the are the points and I&#39;m not talking about the depth of that access, but the points of public access, regardless of what the representation is, it seems to me that in some ways, the sacred</font>	Transcription
2061.611	2075.68	<font color='indigo'>is disproportionately represented. That&#39;s just my, the way that I see it. But I think in terms of spirituals in particular, I know that when I teach like a survey course in African American poetry, I</font>	Transcription
2075.681	2092.9	<font color='indigo'>always talk about not only spirituals but also folktales, folk sayings, a lot of the aphorisms that Sterling Brown lists for example, in in the Negro Caravan is a way of thinking about what was there</font>	Transcription
2092.901	2104.48	<font color='indigo'>in our poetic tradition when there wasn&#39;t as much of it written down as there is now for all of the historical and political and cultural  reasons that we can, that we can talk about. So I see that</font>	Transcription
2104.481	2109.61	<font color='indigo'>linkage as just being as being really important. But I&#39;m interested in this question of...</font>	Transcription

2111.111	2121.34	<font color='sienna'>I think that, you know, the I think our leadership has been, at least, you know, kind of, and when I say public now, I mean public in the sense that it is portrayed in terms of</font>	Transcription
2121.701	2134.93	<font color='sienna'>the white press, that that has been disproportionately, you know, from, you know, the religious community. But in terms of, well, it&#39;s almost like we don&#39;t have any other kind of life, except you are</font>	Transcription
2134.931	2146.09	<font color='sienna'>either in the church or elsewhere in the whorehouse. And those are the two extremes that are that are portrayed. And when we talk about what I, when I speak about what we do with the university, what</font>	Transcription
2146.091	2158.3	<font color='sienna'>we have always emphasized is a circular, secular aspect of life. And that I think that has to do with the whole humanist tradition out of which, you know, most of us work. That people, even when you</font>	Transcription
2158.301	2171.71	<font color='sienna'>are religious, and you go to church, and this is really a part of your life, you very most often do not bring that, obviously, or directly or overtly to bear in your, in your work. I mean, you always</font>	Transcription
2171.711	2182.12	<font color='sienna'>get to kind of surprise when at least I do when singers get up in there accepting the award. And they say, Well, first of all, let me give glory to God. Can you imagine some literary critic standing</font>	Transcription
2182.121	2190.04	<font color='sienna'>up and saying, Well, first of all, let me give glory to God. Now, I&#39;m going to tell you my title. I mean, you just don&#39;t do that. In the academic world.</font>	Transcription

2204.351	2221.18	<font color='#008080'>an important point. Because when I use a great deal of a lot of religious and spiritual allusions in my poetry, but I&#39;m not a church-going person, and I doubt that I ever will be. You know, but I&#39;m a</font>	Transcription
2221.181	2235.13	<font color='#008080'>very spiritual person. But and I recognize the role that that religion and the church has played in the lives of black people. I recognize it and I applaud it, and I celebrate it in my poetry. You</font>	Transcription

2618.641	2635.95	<font color='#008080'>There seems to be a race weariness. We&#39;ve become so weary of being black in America that I detect this among a lot of young people who want to shove it aside and seek other other means</font>	Transcription

2671.621	2680.95	<font color='#008080'>to heaven. And I thought maybe that would have been a term dyspepsia also.</font>	Transcription
2684.55	2698.02	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
2684.551	2698.02	<font color='indigo'>Yeah, but also, I mean, I think that there is that but I think there&#39;s also a lot of blackness policing going on by peers and by an older generation, in some cases, that is very</font>	Transcription
2698.111	2713.83	<font color='indigo'>frustrating sometimes, for young black people trying to find their voice, that there are a lot of versions of blackness that are very prescriptive, you know? Well, you know, the real thing is, you</font>	Transcription
2713.831	2725.65	<font color='indigo'>know, whatever gangster rap is the real thing, or, you know, the real thing is church, or the real thing is, I mean, we could name any number of different versions of the real thing that I think</font>	Transcription
2726.341	2737.53	<font color='indigo'>sometimes have made it, made it difficult for, for young black people who are saying, but the voices inside my head are telling me a lot of different very complicated things. And I will just return to</font>	Transcription
2737.531	2749.65	<font color='indigo'>this, I think this Ellison quote is really important and, and, and helpful, We create the race by creating ourselves and then to our great astonishment, we will have created something far more</font>	Transcription
2749.651	2762.07	<font color='indigo'>important, we will have created a culture. So, I think in a way, one answer to your question, which may sound like a cop out, but I don&#39;t think that it is, is that you know, it is for each black</font>	Transcription
2762.071	2775.66	<font color='indigo'>person to listen to those voices and answer for themselves, what is to be salvaged? What is to be refigured? What is useful? And what is their particular vision of their own black selves? And then and</font>	Transcription
2775.661	2790.81	<font color='indigo'>then how does that fit into a larger context? Because I do think that in the post-integration era that we&#39;re in now, that questions of, you know, who are my relatives who are my ancestors, I do think</font>	Transcription
2790.811	2805.78	<font color='indigo'>that they&#39;re, they&#39;re more complicated, more complicated to negotiate. So I think that it&#39;s some not necessarily saying that each person needs to be solipsistic, to say that each person needs to</font>	Transcription
2805.991	2816.43	<font color='indigo'>answer that question for themselves. And then perhaps even, we could say, it&#39;s not necessarily the writers role, but it&#39;s, you know, sort of critics and commentators role to be additive and to say,</font>	Transcription
2816.431	2829.84	<font color='indigo'>Well, you know, I see this poet and this poet in this, let&#39;s, let&#39;s step back and see what&#39;s happening in in black expressive culture at this moment, and not so much for the individual writer to have</font>	Transcription
2829.841	2836.71	<font color='indigo'>to place themselves in history of the present tense. That&#39;s what I&#39;d say.</font>	Transcription

2837.311	2848.44	<font color='darkcyan'>That&#39;s been the tradition. Writers have always done it. The whole miracle of black poetry is just that kind of speaking out. There are always prescriptions of one kind or another.</font>	Transcription
2850.031	2863.38	<font color='darkcyan'>And the greater voice usually violates them. And it should, and that&#39;s what it means and it will, and nothing should be jettisoned or nothing sacred or nothing can all of it will be used somehow or</font>	Transcription
2863.381	2884.41	<font color='darkcyan'>another. They are no should be-s. By the way. There are surprises, miraculous, wonderful surprises. And those surprises give us the ongoing flowing literature that we have, I think all ages have</font>	Transcription
2884.411	2903.19	<font color='darkcyan'>produced their work anxiety, neuroses, anxiety of influence. But and this one, I don&#39;t think necessarily more than another time, except that the issues are probably more brave.</font>	Transcription

2907.841	2924.61	<font color='darkcyan'>Well, I think integration has changed. Yeah, but I yes. But as I said before, I think that much is the difference between whether those are posed as political questions, or</font>	Transcription
2924.611	2944.86	<font color='darkcyan'>aesthetic ones. You know, what I mean? It&#39;s not that the two don&#39;t conjoin, of course, but I think that there are answers and acute ones, you know, when we turn the lens on one, or the other at a time</font>	Transcription
2945.161	2969.25	<font color='darkcyan'>and then bring them together? Yes, it has posed but in the whole business of, of saying to people stop, you&#39;re saying nasty things about women is a whole new league, right? People used to do that with</font>	Transcription
2969.251	2986.29	<font color='darkcyan'>impunity, did they not? Yes or no other[?] thing. The whole business as you pointed out, people addressing in public I mean, we take these things for granted they are not for granted things to take.</font>	Transcription

3047.221	3059.73	<font color='chartreuse'>Good morning, my name is Monifa Love. And we&#39;re going to be a little long in the build up to the question. Sun Ra, in an interview, said that he was playing a music that he felt was</font>	Transcription
3059.851	3073.65	<font color='chartreuse'>part of the music that kept the world together. And that he definitely felt without certain music being played, the world would fly apart. Going back to the question before about spiritual issues,</font>	Transcription
3074.071	3089.01	<font color='chartreuse'>poets amongst themselves talk about writing poems that will turn people inside out. But we don&#39;t talk about that either as a political issue or an aesthetic issue. Do you think that people, is there a</font>	Transcription
3089.011	3103.8	<font color='chartreuse'>place where we can talk about what we think we&#39;re doing on the page beyond personal expression beyond protest? But somehow, In the beginning, there was the word kind of idea on the on the page? Do you</font>	Transcription
3103.801	3105.33	<font color='chartreuse'>understand what I&#39;m trying to get at?</font>	Transcription
3109.74	3121.89	<font color='sienna'><b>Sherley Anne Williams</b></font>	Speaker
3109.741	3121.89	<font color='sienna'>Understand what you are trying to get at? But I&#39;m not sure of you know, if you&#39;re using the word talk, metaphorically, meaning Is there, you know, do we write about these things</font>	Transcription
3121.891	3136.17	<font color='sienna'>also? Or, or what? But it also seems to me that what you are talking about, for me, at least is a very, you know, private kind of question. And that while I&#39;m willing to, you know, to really talk</font>	Transcription
3136.171	3151.41	<font color='sienna'>about technique, and how you achieve certain kinds of effects, I&#39;m less willing to talk about what for me is like the beginning or, you know, on and on, in those kinds of terms, because, as I say, I</font>	Transcription
3151.411	3163.86	<font color='sienna'>mean, it is very personal, it is very private. And in some sense, I guess, I kind of have the feeling that when you begin to probe too deeply into certain sources of your own art, at least for me, I,</font>	Transcription
3164.371	3178.5	<font color='sienna'>I just really want to back away, I&#39;m not wanting to expose that in the way that something has to be exposed, or at least the attempt made when you begin to put certain things into words.</font>	Transcription

3180.131	3193.24	<font color='indigo'>And I would just give two off-the-top-of-my-head recommendations, to turn back to Robert Hayden&#39;s poetry. And to go and think about, I mean, the way in which his work is very much</font>	Transcription
3193.241	3206.29	<font color='indigo'>informed by his being Bahai but also I think, is explicitly striving to address some of the spiritual questions that you seem to be interested in. And also, there&#39;s a new book by Cyrus Cassells,</font>	Transcription
3206.291	3216.82	<font color='indigo'>called Soul Make a Path through Shouting that just came out from Copper Canyon Press that I think you might find addresses some of those spiritual concerns.</font>	Transcription

3217.801	3219.24	<font color='#008080'>One question here, please.</font>	Transcription
3220.26	3230.19	<font color='crimson'><b>Mylea Thompson</b></font>	Speaker
3220.261	3230.19	<font color='crimson'>Yes, my name is Mylea Thompson, and I&#39;m from Norfolk State University. My major is English, and I&#39;m an undergraduate. The question I have for you this morning, is can you please tell</font>	Transcription
3230.191	3242.22	<font color='crimson'>me why a poem should have more than one meaning. I, as a poet, sometimes when I write, I only have one thing to say, and that&#39;s exactly what I mean, when I put it down. Why do you feel that it is</font>	Transcription
3243.031	3246.66	<font color='crimson'>wonderful for a poem to have so many different meanings?</font>	Transcription
3247.26	3255.81	<font color='sienna'><b>Sherley Anne Williams</b></font>	Speaker
3247.261	3255.81	<font color='sienna'>I don&#39;t think I actually said so many different meanings. I said something about, you know, bring evoking different nuances. And, you know, that kind of thing that it doesn&#39;t</font>	Transcription
3255.991	3268.02	<font color='sienna'>mean exactly the same thing every single time. But even though you have said exactly what you want to say in your poem, doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m going to get exactly what you have said out of it. I may,</font>	Transcription
3268.021	3279.93	<font color='sienna'>in fact find not something we hope you know, an entirely different because I think if it&#39;s an entirely different from what you intended, then you the writer has failed, but that I may find something</font>	Transcription
3279.931	3294.18	<font color='sienna'>more than what you intended. And, you know, using what you you know, the basic word, I may in fact come to you know, something that you know, you may have wanted me to get to A and I get to A and go</font>	Transcription
3294.181	3309.78	<font color='sienna'>on to B because it&#39;s there impossible given the associations of images of words of sounds and those kinds of things. If you don&#39;t get something different, not so much different, but something new, a</font>	Transcription
3309.781	3324.96	<font color='sienna'>kind of refreshed feeling out of a work of art, whether it is a poem or a picture or a whatever, then as I say, I don&#39;t believe that it really it&#39;s not doing its job, that you want to find something</font>	Transcription
3325.261	3337.41	<font color='sienna'>else there. When I go back and reread things, as you know, we all periodically do when I look at a poem, look at a picture again. I&#39;m looking for that, that thing that I missed the first time, because</font>	Transcription
3337.411	3342.63	<font color='sienna'>it&#39;s not really possible to take the whole of it in at one glance.</font>	Transcription
3343.53	3353.01	<font color='indigo'><b>Elizabeth Alexander</b></font>	Speaker
3343.531	3353.01	<font color='indigo'>And also, I mean, I agree very much with what you&#39;re saying and feel quite militant about it actually, that, you know, poems good poems are living documents. And I say that as</font>	Transcription
3353.011	3361.98	<font color='indigo'>someone who writes them, and someone who reads them, because, you know, while I mean, sloppy reading is one thing, and let&#39;s just put that to the side. I mean, I think if you read something, and you</font>	Transcription
3361.981	3371.67	<font color='indigo'>don&#39;t, if someone&#39;s not paying attention to what you have put forward on the page, and they want to make it completely their own thing, well, then go write another poem, that that&#39;s something else.</font>	Transcription
3371.881	3388.41	<font color='indigo'>But it seems to me that once I write something, it goes out into the world. And then there&#39;s someone like me on the other end, who says, you know, who is to know precisely precisely what Robert Hayden</font>	Transcription
3388.441	3403.92	<font color='indigo'>or anyone whose poetry has been important to me what exactly they meant. They&#39;ve given us something. And then I think it&#39;s our job and our great fortune, to be able to regard it, pay close attention</font>	Transcription
3403.921	3416.43	<font color='indigo'>to it and then make the associations that that we will. I think that that&#39;s, that&#39;s what makes art great and that&#39;s what makes it more than just a telephone call.</font>	Transcription
