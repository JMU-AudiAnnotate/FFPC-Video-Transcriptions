8.388229	16.182442	Brenda Marie Osbey, B-r-e-n-d-a M-a-r-i-e O-s-b-e-y.
17.856488	26.442723	Brenda, last night you were reading the poem Nina Simone and I was wondering if you would talk a little bit about how she's been a figure of inspiration, or--
27.504752	52.129425	The Nina Simone poem came about almost exactly as it's described in the poem. It, um... I was away from New Orleans in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in fact, and a friend called, and told me a story about a Nina Simone concert, where she indeed did curse the audience out.
52.129425	79.058162	And that got me thinking about Nina Simone as a kind of an image, as an overpowering image of my girlhood. My best girlfriend Marceline and I really did have an incident where her sister came into the bedroom and found us messing with her stuff, and said to us, if we wanted to be so grown, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
79.058162	109.442992	And so the story about the Nina Simone concert, sparked a series of memories about moments in time, when Nina Simone as a kind of iconic figure, sort of rose to the fore in a, in what seemed a very personal way. And so that was how the poem started, it really did sort of bring back those kinds of memories of experiences.
109.839003	128.775521	In the poem, it seems to me Nina Simone is a symbol of the rejected Black artist, and the artist specifically rejected by the African American community. Are there other figures that you see fitting into that paradigm or, or how do you relate her position to the position of the African American artist generally?
129.81955	159.988375	It isn't so much that it represents a rejection, I think, as as a tendency to take things for granted, and to take people for granted, and to take singers and poets and artists and voices, all of whom, and all of which represent us-- to take those things for granted because they are in fact there. And because they're part and parcel of the community, they are part of who we are.
159.988375	185.981085	And so... I think it's just an indication of an age and a time and a sense of what makes sense, of what is right. It's only when we look back later, that it seems that we've committed some-- some great error, some great sin as it were.
185.981085	204.701597	And, but she becomes in the poem far more symbolic of that entire tendency. But I mean, if you think of popular singers, and how popular singers go in and out of vogue and in and out of style, that kind of thing happens all the time. What was different about Nina Simone was that she represented an era.
204.701597	219.462001	And my sense is that she knew that she represented that era. And there was a certain kind of cooperation and participation that was expected of all of the rest of us.
219.462001	252.582906	And my sense, I have a very strong sense that we did not hold up our end of the bargain, but that perhaps there was no way for us to know that until it was too late anyway. And so the poem is a poem about regret. But it's regret about a situation that really can't be changed. And maybe the tone is not so much regret, as as it says it's a kind of recounting a kind of telling to play back against those other images. When we, when we in fact were all the evening news.
252.582906	279.655647	And it's an attempt to capture, not-- maybe not one era, but a series of eras. And Nina Simone seems to be present throughout. She seems now to have been a constant. And the poem is a sense of our-- of a kind of communal regret, personalized, where the speaker takes on the confessional attitude of the group, of the community, of the 'We'.
280.591672	302.10226	And then the other poem you read last night you referred to sugar as such a central part of the African diaspora, one of the main motivations for the slave trade being the production of sugar. Was your poem an attempt to re-appropriate or reclaim sugar as a part of our experience in a more positive sense?
302.10226	328.544983	Well, I come from a place where sugar is very important. Louisiana was a sugar state. And the portion of the poem that I read-- it's a rather long poem, and I read an excerpt from it. And so that portion is the introduction to the topic of sugar. And much later in the poem, there's all this stuff about the processing of sugar, and the growing of sugar and all of this stuff.
328.544983	355.545722	But it also-- there are a series of plays on that word sugar, and the many ways that we use it: we call one another sugar, and so forth. And the poem is an attempt to, to look at the paradox of this sweet, sticky substance, that is also the source of rum, the intoxicating substance,
355.545722	382.90647	and that that seems to say so much about our experience in the New World-- sugar was one of the reasons we were here. And we produce sugar, and we consume sugar. And when we are ill with diabetes, we say that we have sugar. And we call one another sugar. And we sugarcoat things.
382.90647	408.809178	And in a city like New Orleans, of course, one of the things we're famous for is pastries, and sweets. And we have all kinds of names for various kinds of sweet, sweet, sweet goods and sweet foods. And one of the ones that is typical of New Orleans is hot calas, and calas are rice cakes, which of course there's a double meaning there because we also were a rice area, Louisiana was rather, not New Orleans.
408.809178	438.50999	And so rice and sugar together-- compounding of the experience of the enslaved and oppressed. And also, there's a lot of bodily imagery in the poem, because of course this is intense, backbreaking labor. And so the poem is an attempt to look at-- not just at slavery, but at enslavement as a specific kind of violence,
438.50999	473.376944	as a specific kind of action, and to personalize it in a way that perhaps makes sense to us. One of the-- one of my firmest beliefs is that no one ever thought of herself as a slave. That 'slave' was not anyone's name or job title or, or any other such thing that, that people were persons first, in their own mind's eye and their own imagination prior to anything else.
473.376944	491.773447	And so in the poem, I create a series of characters who speak. And it's called a cautionary, a cautionary fabulous, a cautionary tale. The title is, the title is 'How to Make Sugar, a Cautionary Fabulous Writ Small'.
491.773447	518.558179	So one of the things that the poem does is it appropriates the colonial and colonizing voice, the dehumanizing voice, but writing against that constantly. And I think the authoritative voice in the poem is the voice of the woman who speaks and who is spoken about and who is written about and who is unreachable, unattainable and who remains removed from all of this.
518.558179	538.430722	And backing her up, I suppose, are the women who are called the vendeurs, the sellers. And there are marketplace scenes and so forth in which the women are observed and observe others observing them. So it's a poem about representation, and a poem about the making of a series of images,
538.430722	566.259483	and the whole sensual passage about the tying  of the tignon, and how important that is, and how it attaches to the free status of these particular women who are vendeurs. I think it's an important point to make that even within the free Black community there is this obsession with containment and tying and burdening.
566.51149	588.265085	The difference there is that the vendeurs, these free Black women, are doing their own form of containment and tying. Their heads are tied in these sumptuous cloths. There's a passage later on in the poem that I didn't read, that talks about how they layer their ankles in gold and silver bracelets because this represents their freedom, oddly enough. 
589.624122	603.669006	And-- so it's a poem about the making of an image and perhaps the remaking and the reconstituting of a self against such incredible odds, I think. I could be wrong.
603.664506	619.000925	Your work, obviously, is deeply rooted in New Orleans and its history, and its African American communities. Can you speak a little bit about how you see yourself, potentially as a New Orleans poet?
619.000925	641.46554	I think it's the most important thing about, about the work I do is that it's, it-- it all grows out of an attempt to understand something about New Orleans. One of the things that growing up in New Orleans does is it gives you a sense of an essentially intact cultural environment.
641.46554	670.482333	And of a cultural environment that is its own thing that clearly is African American, but is African American in its own rather specific, and improvised upon, and constantly improvising, way. And so I've spent most of my writing life, studying New Orleans, studying the African presence in New Orleans, studying traditional religion in New Orleans,
670.482333	698.491099	as a way of understanding something about perspective, I suppose. Something about perspective, something about shape, something about how things are made. Because the poem-- I love the word poetry, the word poem. Poesis, the made thing, it is a thing that is made that is constructed that has its own entity in the world. Once it is made, it's apart from me. And it's no longer mine.
698.491099	725.095826	And it stands out there, if it's any good, it stands out there on its own without me to support it. And so I think that something about New Orleans, something about the specific history of slavery endured there, something about the very specific kinds of resistance, something about our peculiar dance forms, things like the second line,
725.095826	755.552659	things like hot calas, the bending of form, the recreating, and the fracturing of form, and space, and time, a kind of disbelief even in time; that history isn't the past, history is what happens. And so history is acting in us, we are acting in it, and we were acting upon it all of the time, that it's always all going on. And that's the beauty of the dance that we call second line,
755.552659	783.453422	that while the primary procession is taking place, the formal procession is taking place, there are-- there's this band, or rather there are multiple bands of people gathered along the side, who are doing these other things. And each time they do the other thing, it takes a different form. Nobody dances the second line exactly the same way twice. There's certain basic steps, certain basic movements, and you do countless variations on those. 
783.453422	807.034067	And the beauty of the thing is that somehow we all can do it, I don't know any New Orleanians who can't do it, we all can do it. We all recognize it when we see it. And yet we all do it differently. We know what is and is not second line. But it's always changing, it's constantly changing. And-- so everything is always happening.
807.034067	829.678686	And it isn't an a-historical approach. It's probably a multi-layered approach to history as a thing from within, as opposed to a thing imposed from without. And that's the thing is that I have a fascination with history. And I have a fascination with poets who have a problem with history.
829.678686	856.643423	And I think some of our greatest poets, certainly some of our greatest narrative poets have a problem with history. And that is the thing that makes-- that makes them so compelling. Robert Hayden has a problem with history, and so he writes in history, in order to work out these narrative moments and to make them real to us. Gayl Jones has a problem with history, and she's always rediscovering it and reshaping it.
856.643423	882.744137	Sherley Anne Williams has a problem with history in her long narrative poems. Jay Wright has a problem with history. And so history becomes the problem. It becomes the thing that you look at, the thing that you worry, the thing that you finger. It's the scab, it's the sore, and you work around it constantly. It's always there, and it never quite goes away. It's never finished. And therefore neither are we.
882.744137	906.64879	So that we're constantly working, and it isn't so much revising, as it is revisioning. That we have to learn to see history in our own image, so to speak. We have to, I think, learn and we have to teach ourselves over and over again what our history really is, and what our place is in our history, or histories.
907.0088	926.665338	So poetry in some ways it sounds like is a way of rewriting official histories, in your work. I'm wondering if the form, the long poem particularly, allows you to deal with your concerns about simultaneity of experience, multiplicity, and improvisation.
926.665338	952.586047	Yeah, the long narrative poem-- it seems to me the older I get the longer the poems get! The long narrative poem has become for me an ideal form. On the one hand, it's quite open, you can do all kinds of things, you can have a multitude of narrative and lyric voices happening in there. Recently, I've been experimenting with rhyme in the long poem.
952.586047	976.310695	And it's an open form. And yet, at the same time, it's a form that breaks certain boundaries, in a very conscientious way. When we think of narrative, I think it's common to think of a story with a beginning, middle, and end. And yet, if you look at truly fine narrative poems, that doesn't exist in truly fine narrative, narrative poems.
976.310695	998.271296	In Robert Hayden's Middle Passage, for instance, there is not a beginning, middle and end. We begin in the middle or at the end, we can't tell which it is, it depends on, on who's actually reading the poem. But we have snippets and passages and excerpts of things, of documents, of things that both support and critique reality.
998.271296	1030.924189	And because we have all of that laid bare for us, it's like walking into a room where we have the option to rearrange everything each time we enter the room. Or perhaps each time we enter the room, we see the room as a different environment, and we organize it to suit our purposes for that moment. So that the poem exists in a kind of moment that is that moment at that time. 
1031.248197	1040.320445	So then the poem exists-- or does it create then a whole? Or is it another type of representation of a fragmentation?
1040.320445	1070.021258	I wonder that there are these wholes that we constantly seek out. I wonder. I was raised in a tradition that believes very much in whole, in the whole in the beauty of the whole. That a thing is good when it is beautiful, a thing is beautiful when it is whole, that wholeness and beauty and health all go together, that those are all the same thing. And so on the one hand I was brought up in a tradition that, that holds very dearly to that principle.
1070.021258	1086.509708	And yet at the same time, the poems that I write are by nature fragmentary, and purposely fragmenting the scene, or the character, or the speaker, or the narrative, or the image.
1086.509708	1112.430417	There are lots of images of broken things, and sometimes stanzas seem to end at a point where nothing has actually happened. Something might be about to happen. But we don't know yet what that is, and we don't find out in that poem. So that we get bits and pieces. And the thing is, it isn't the story that's important, it is the thing that eventually, we begin to realize as readers. 
1112.430417	1128.594859	It isn't the story that matters in the narrative poem, it's how the story is being told, why the story is being told. And who are the voices telling these stories? And do we trust them? Do we know them? Are they us?
1129.926896	1154.551569	So it's, it's, it's about possibilities, I think, much more so than about, than about the story itself. And I think that's a major difference between the writing of prose fiction, and the writing of the narrative poem, that the purpose is different. My purpose is never to tell a story when I start out.
1154.551569	1179.968264	What happens is that I come across a story, I find a story, or a story finds me, and I find it compelling in some way, and try to see how many ways I can approach that story, and how many versions or voices that story might exist in. And sometimes within the same character, within the same narrative, within the same narrator, there might be multiple voices going on, so. 
1179.968264	1193.144624	And in terms of the larger picture of African American poetry, do you have a sense of yourself as a part of a movement or part of a contemporary sensibility?
1193.144624	1217.985303	A part of a movement, I would say probably not, in all honesty, probably not. I started publishing in the late 1970s, and I certainly have some major influences and some major references, I think.
1217.985303	1241.025933	But I've never, I've never been a joiner. And so I've never seen my work as belonging to a particular movement. I do see that it belongs in a certain moment, though. But those are really questions, I suppose, to be determined later, after the passage of much time.
1241.025933	1264.246568	But I do see African American poetry attempting to acquire a new freshness, a new kind of experimentation with language that is perhaps not quite so reverent as it once was, that there is a newly awakened sense of play,
1264.246568	1283.147085	and a newly awakened sense of-- and when I talk about play, I'm talking about taking a kind of joy in the language and seeing the language as the instrument that it is. So that there is not such an awe of the beauty of language, that we can also toy with the ugliness of language.
1283.147085	1312.127877	And that we can represent horrible things in beautiful language is one of the most shocking, one of the most shocking things. I think it happens in prose fiction quite a lot as well. There's that beautiful passage in Toni Morrison's Beloved where Sethe is attempting to behead her child because the slavers are coming. And it's one of the most beautiful passages, I think, in the English language.
1312.127877	1333.620465	And there is a kind of holy, quiet, that surrounds that moment. That's the moment of poetry. That's the stuff that we that we hold to and cling to, and embrace. And yet the act is so horrible, that we are able to see a kind of beauty in it.
1333.620465	1351.872964	Holy quiet. That's a lovely phrase. I'm thinking about your knowledge of language, and languages, and I'm wondering how being fluent in several languages influences your own work, and your understanding of the complexities of language and meaning.
1351.872964	1366.381361	I would say I have an obsession with language and languages and, and that I collect language and languages, I suppose, in the way that other people collect objects.
1367.46139	1389.493993	And it goes back pretty far, I suppose. I've always had a fascination with language and with languages, because something tells me that, that there's always something in there, there's always some possibility in there. And of course, there are things that we can express in certain languages that we can't express in other languages there-- finally, there are things that are that are non-translatable.
1390.898031	1418.474785	There's no French word for gumbo. Because the concept doesn't exist, because the experience doesn't exist, because the ingredients don't exist. So you make it as best you possibly can in this other environment, but you have to call it gumbo. That's what it is. And... and yet there's a layering that takes place there. There's a layering of experience, and a layering of language.
1418.474785	1450.623664	And one of the things that fascinates me about Black folk, wherever we find them is the extent to which we have always joyed in language. We're a tongue people. We believe in loose tongues and free tongues. And one of the things that I think it's very easy to forget nowadays with the 21st century, one of the things that's very easy to forget, is that we came to the new world as a multilingual people.
1450.623664	1470.640212	And we perhaps lost or discarded languages along the way. And I think there's a kind of imperative that we make some attempt to reclaim some of those languages, as best we possibly can. And to embrace language.
1471.828244	1500.665033	And language is one of those things that's, of course, always been used against us as a tool, as a weapon. And it's the kind of thing that we've always embraced and said-- a perfect example of that is Creole language. You take the masters' language, which might be French or Spanish or Portuguese or Dutch. And you say this is your language. This is the language of the master. This is the language in which you control me. This is the language in which you turn me into an abject object. This is the language in which you denigrate me.
1500.665033	1523.165648	I will show you what I can do with your language, I will give it back to you in this fractured, twisted form. And you tell me, can you understand what I'm doing with this language now? Can you speak this language. And of course, the reality is that you find very few people who are not born into a creole speaking environment, who speak those languages and understand those languages.
1523.165648	1539.042082	And even when we translate those languages into our use of English, which certainly is what happens in a place like Louisiana, you find us coming up with these newly concocted arrangements of language and turn, turns of phrase,
1539.042082	1570.43494	and, and that's the thing I think, where we find beauty in the language is it's the turn of phrase. It isn't the funny spellings of, of plantation dialect. And poets who use Black folk speech, we're never really trying to do plantation dialect that was imposed from the exterior. They were trying to capture the authenticity of Black skill: the ability to improvise and to make language, to make words.
1570.43494	1599.883746	And finally, that's what poetry is really all about. More so I think that all of the other literary art forms, poetry is lodged in language, and you have to go through the language-- there is no other way. If it doesn't exist in the poem, if it doesn't exist in the text, then it ain't there. And you can't, you can't put it there, you have to enter the poem through the language. And part of what that means is that you have to be able to enter the poet's world.
1599.883746	1615.04016	And is that-- entering the poet's world, minority poets or African American poets-- do you find that that's a particularly difficult thing for audiences to do, or how do you negotiate that gap as a poet?
1615.184164	1645.208985	It's less difficult for audiences to do it I think, than for academics and critics to do. Because, again, academics and critics frequently are imposing an external structure. And the difference that we see is--  I think it's best illustrated when we look at the difference in audience response at a live poetry reading, and the dearth of criticism and critical study of African American poetry.
1647.369044	1674.405783	Huge gap, there's a huge gap there. The audience listening to the poem, seeing the poem, hearing the poem being performed, understands the poem, grasps the poem, responds to the poem in the moment. And that's a wonderful thing to be a part of. One of the best things about poetry is the live poetry reading. Because there's a kind of energy that takes place, there's something that passes between the poet and the audience, when it's working.
1674.405783	1698.850452	When everything is going well, there's this energy that passes back and forth between the poet and the audience. And we feed on that, it's a mutual thing. That doesn't necessarily happen with the critic. It doesn't necessarily happen. Because there's this attempt to impose this order from outside. And one of the things that the poet, of course wants to do is to break the rules, and to destroy the order, and perhaps to create a new order.
1698.850452	1712.67483	Well, I mean we were talking about the importance of performance, it sounds to me, in terms of your own work and energy that you derive from audiences. How would you distinguish what you do in poetry reading from spoken word poetry [inaudible]?
1712.67483	1734.779434	I think it's quite different. I could be very wrong about this, but spoken word seems to me to involve a truly theatrical bent, and intent. I think what happens when I'm reading, I'm trying to read well,
1735.35545	1758.612086	I'm trying to read the poem in the voices that are speaking in the poem whether there are narrators functioning as actual narrators or not, and that's quite different. And I think what happens also is that there is the ability to improvise, it's not that I'm reading words that aren't on the page, or that I'm leaving out words that are on the page.
1758.792091	1782.588741	But each reading of the poem is going to be different than every other reading of the poem, a poem like the Nina Simone poem-- there are occasions where I will read it with more or less verve, with more or less bounce, with more or less volume, with more or less emphasis on certain lines, phrases, stanzas.
1782.588741	1800.517231	And that happens-- very, much of that happens in the moment when the poet realizes who that audience is and what that response is like, and so it becomes a kind of a wave that you ride.
1800.517231	1807.249416	And you're saying to come back to that idea of improvisation?
1803.0373	1803.577315	Mmhmm.
1803.577315	1807.249416	And what are you working on now [inaudible] projects?
1807.249416	1825.573917	Lots of things. I'm working on lots of things. I'm working on a series of essays about my experiences in France, going back to France after more than 20 years, 30-some years, 30 years I guess.
1826.005928	1851.926637	I did my undergrad as-- part of my undergraduate studies I did in France and returned to the southern region for six months to work on a new book project that's a bilingual French-English (smattering of Creole), project about slavery and resistance in Louisiana under the French colonial regime. So that's one project, and then there are two other poetry manuscripts.
1852.214645	1873.455226	Also having to do with Louisiana with New Orleans as a topic. But one of them does a lot of experimentation with rhyme, which I've never used, or never used to great effect before. I also write creative nonfiction. So there's a body of essays that I'm working on right now.
1873.455226	1899.015925	And then there is a series of, I guess, for lack of a better word, dispatches about my experiences returning to France after all of those years, looking at French racism, which not only has not improved in the past 30 years, but has intensified and worsened in rather graphic ways.
1899.015925	1918.168448	And so there're always a number of projects going on when, when I'm working well, I'm working on a number of projects. Because just because one thing isn't going well, at one moment, doesn't mean that I can't work on something else. So there's always something, some iron in the fire. 
1919.032472	1945.133186	The way that you're speaking of your experiences in France and New Orleans, it seems to me that you've constructed yourself in feeling as if you're a person with multiple influences and multiple identities in terms of your heritage. And I'm wondering how the label of African American either fits that description or fits your self-- your self-structure or in some ways may even be limiting?
1945.133186	1977.318066	I think it fits perfectly, I think it's-- I think it's about as precise and as exact as we can get. I really think it is because it means a lot of different things at the same time. Of course, historically, we're an African people in the Americas. And there're so many versions and variations of that. And of course, there's a tendency to think of African American as a monolith, which of course, it never is, never was.
1977.318066	1995.462562	And there has been a tendency sometimes on the part of critics looking at my work to say, well, this is not, this is not African American, this is not Black, this is New Orleans. And, and while New Orleans certainly is its own space, its own culture, that space and that culture have always been Black space.
1995.462562	2025.451382	And so it's one of those-- one of the things that I always say is that when we make those kinds of distinctions, that slavery under the French was better or slavery under the Spaniards was better or slavery under the British-- my slave master's better than your slave master never made any sense to me at all. We're talking about different experiences, we're talking about different cultural influences, we're talking about different, different approaches to acquiring and claiming freedom.
2025.451382	2052.956134	And a lot of that stuff is contained in language. And in part, there's a very practical side to that a lot of that is contained in language, because law is written in language. And so once you have the black codes promulgated in the French Caribbean, and later in Louisiana, that sets the tone for how freedom will be denied and claimed and bartered against.
2052.956134	2081.792922	And so certainly African American, I think entirely fits who I am and what I do. But the other thing that I think is that when we look at the Americas, in the broader sense, the things that we single out, as having uniquely to do with the Americas, as opposed to those things having to do with Europe, those things having to do with Africa,
2081.792922	2099.145397	what we're looking at is the influence of people of African descent in the new world. And I don't think we yet realize the hugeness of that reality. I don't think we yet understand what that means.
2099.325402	2124.922102	When ever American culture is transported, what is transported and what is received is something that is Black in its origins. And that's something that I think we need to be very clear about stating and laying claim to and making clear for ourselves, because I think we often are not aware of the extent of our influence in the culture. 
2124.922102	2154.874921	And I think in part, it's because the United States in particular is such a large space geographically, and such a broad space culturally, that it's easy for us not to look beyond the boundaries of the 48 states. But once we step outside of that, and we begin to look at cultures across the world, things begin to make much more sense to us. And our role in the world begins to make much more sense to us.
2154.874921	2179.895605	And how we are depicted and represented, and how we are written about and spoken about, and how we claim the language and languages in which we will write about our own selves, and our own experiences-- those are the things that actually signify America and the Americas in terms of culture, and in terms of cultural transmissions.
2179.895605	2205.420303	And I think that, maybe it's a little bit easier for poets to be aware of that, because I think poets may have a tendency to read across genres and across languages, much more so than other folk, it isn't uncommon for poets to read bilingually, trilingually, or at least to work with bilingual texts. It isn't-- it isn't as unusual perhaps for us to do that.
2206.932344	2230.404986	And to work with translators of our work. It isn't uncommon that translations of prose fiction occur without any participation by the author. It's somewhat rare that such translations occur without the participation of the poet. That's somewhat rare, actually.
2230.404986	2232.961056	Getting a [inaudible] is like being a sort of [inaudible] poetry.
2232.277037	2246.893437	It really is, it really is, and  deciding what remains in the original language, and what gets translated becomes the tricky part. And that's finally how we determine what is or is not a good translation of a poem. 
2248.297475	2248.909492	In terms--
2248.909492	2251.177554	I think, one short question. 
2251.177554	2251.825572	Okay
2251.825572	2253.841627	A Short question with a shorter answer.
2255.101661	2262.01385	Just to conclude, what directions do you see African or American poetry going in the 21st century? 
2262.01385	2288.33057	I think that we're in a place now, where African American poetry in the 21st century is the vanguard. And I think we're maybe not quite aware of that. But African American poetry in the 20th century really is the vanguard, and frankly, always has been the cutting edge for what was happening in poetry in this society.
2288.33057	2312.307225	That we were the modernizers of language in the 1910s and 20s. We brought jazz into written art. We transformed language, we brought in the vernacular, we remade the American language. It is as much ours perhaps more ours than any other group.
2313.171249	2316.303335	Well thank you so much for your time.
2316.591342	2323.179523	Excellent. Thank you! You guys need more time. We need more tape!
2323.179523	2332.791785	Oh oh, don't move yet. We're just gonna get 30 seconds of tape, okay. If you guys could just have any kind of conversation, just don't all talk at once [inaudible].
2332.791785	2335.203851	So, you're taking off tomorrow, right?
2335.203851	2342.260044	Yep, yep. I get back home tomorrow. This has been really really good. [Inaudible]
2342.260044	2343.700084	It has been.
2343.700084	2345.248126	Wait, no wait, Don't look at me!
2345.500133	2346.040148	Sorry.
2346.256154	2346.616163	Sorry!
2346.904171	2348.200207	You live in New Orleans?
2348.200207	2354.644383	I live in New Orleans, yeah, I live in New Orleans. 
2355.184398	2358.100477	When you, you travel very frequently out of the country then?
2358.100477	2365.102669	Well, no, not frequently. I went to school in France when I was a kid, when I was an undergraduate. And this going back with--
