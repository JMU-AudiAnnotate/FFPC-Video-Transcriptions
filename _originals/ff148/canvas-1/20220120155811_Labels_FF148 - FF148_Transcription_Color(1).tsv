17.856488	26.442723	<font color="#008080">Brenda, last night you were reading the poem Nina Simone and I was wondering if you would talk a little bit about how she's been a figure of inspiration, or--</font>	Transcription, Question
27.504752	52.129425	<font color="navy">The Nina Simone poem came about almost exactly as it's described in the poem. I was away from New Orleans in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in fact, and a friend called, and told me a story about a Nina Simone concert, where she indeed did curse the audience out.</font>	Transcription
52.129425	79.058162	<font color="navy">And that got me thinking about Nina Simone as a kind of an image, as an overpowering image of my girlhood. My best girlfriend Marceline and I really did have an incident where her sister came into the bedroom and found us messing with her stuff, and said to us, if we wanted to be so grown, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</font>	Transcription
79.058162	109.442992	<font color="navy">And so the story about the Nina Simone concert, sparked a series of memories about moments in time, when Nina Simone as a kind of iconic figure, sort of rose to the fore in a, in what seemed a very personal way. And so that was how the poem started, it really did sort of bring back those kinds of memories of experiences.</font>	Transcription
109.839003	128.775521	<font color="#008080">In the poem, it seems to me Nina Simone is a symbol of the rejected Black artist, and the artist specifically rejected by the African American community. Are there other figures that you see fitting into that paradigm or, or how do you relate her position to the position of the African American artist generally?</font>	Transcription
129.81955	159.988375	<font color="navy">It isn't so much that it represents a rejection, I think, as as a tendency to take things for granted, and to take people for granted, and to take singers and poets and artists and voices, all of whom, and all of which represent us-- to take those things for granted because they are in fact there. And because they're part and parcel of the community, they are part of who we are.</font>	Transcription
159.988375	185.981085	<font color="navy">And so... I think it's just an indication of an age and a time and a sense of what makes sense, of what is right. It's only when we look back later, that it seems that we've committed some-- some great error, some great sin as it were.</font>	Transcription
185.981085	204.701597	<font color="navy">And, but she becomes in the poem far more symbolic of that entire tendency. But I mean, if you think of popular singers, and how popular singers go in and out of vogue and in and out of style, that kind of thing happens all the time. What was different about Nina Simone was that she represented an era.</font>	Transcription
204.701597	219.462001	<font color="navy">And my sense is that she knew that she represented that era. And there was a certain kind of cooperation and participation that was expected of all of the rest of us.</font>	Transcription
219.462001	252.582906	<font color="navy">And my sense, I have a very strong sense that we did not hold up our end of the bargain, but that perhaps there was no way for us to know that until it was too late anyway. And so the poem is a poem about regret. But it's regret about a situation that really can't be changed. And maybe the tone is not so much regret, as as it says it's a kind of recounting a kind of telling to play back against those other images. When we, when we in fact were all the evening news.</font>	Transcription
252.582906	279.655647	<font color="navy">And it's an attempt to capture, not-- maybe not one era, but a series of eras. And Nina Simone seems to be present throughout. She seems now to have been a constant. And the poem is a sense of our-- of a kind of communal regret, personalized, where the speaker takes on the confessional attitude of the group, of the community, of the 'We'.</font>	Transcription
280.591672	302.10226	<font color="#008080">And then the other poem you read last night you referred to sugar as such a central part of the African diaspora, one of the main motivations for the slave trade being the production of sugar. Was your poem an attempt to re-appropriate or reclaim sugar as a part of our experience in a more positive sense?</font>	Transcription, Question
302.10226	328.544983	<font color="navy">Well, I come from a place where sugar is very important. Louisiana was a sugar state. And the portion of the poem that I read-- it's a rather long poem, and I read an excerpt from it. And so that portion is the introduction to the topic of sugar. And much later in the poem, there's all this stuff about the processing of sugar, and the growing of sugar and all of this stuff.</font>	Transcription
328.544983	355.545722	<font color="navy">But it also-- there are a series of plays on that word sugar, and the many ways that we use it: we call one another sugar, and so forth. And the poem is an attempt to, to look at the paradox of this sweet, sticky substance, that is also the source of rum, the intoxicating substance,</font>	Transcription
355.545722	382.90647	<font color="navy">and that that seems to say so much about our experience in the New World-- sugar was one of the reasons we were here. And we produce sugar, and we consume sugar. And when we are ill with diabetes, we say that we have sugar. And we call one another sugar. And we sugarcoat things.</font>	Transcription
382.90647	408.809178	<font color="navy">And in a city like New Orleans, of course, one of the things we're famous for is pastries, and sweets. And we have all kinds of names for various kinds of sweet, sweet, sweet goods and sweet foods. And one of the ones that is typical of New Orleans is hot calas, and calas are rice cakes, which of course there's a double meaning there because we also were a rice area, Louisiana was rather, not New Orleans.</font>	Transcription
408.809178	438.50999	<font color="navy">And so rice and sugar together-- compounding of the experience of the enslaved and oppressed. And also, there's a lot of bodily imagery in the poem, because of course this is intense, backbreaking labor. And so the poem is an attempt to look at-- not just at slavery, but at enslavement as a specific kind of violence,</font>	Transcription
438.50999	473.376944	<font color="navy">as a specific kind of action, and to personalize it in a way that perhaps makes sense to us. One of the-- one of my firmest beliefs is that no one ever thought of herself as a slave. That 'slave' was not anyone's name or job title or, or any other such thing that, that people were persons first, in their own mind's eye and their own imagination prior to anything else.</font>	Transcription
473.376944	491.773447	<font color="navy">And so in the poem, I create a series of characters who speak. And it's called a cautionary, a cautionary fabulous, a cautionary tale. The title is, the title is 'How to Make Sugar, a Cautionary Fabulous Writ Small'.</font>	Transcription
491.773447	518.558179	<font color="navy">So one of the things that the poem does is it appropriates the colonial and colonizing voice, the dehumanizing voice, but writing against that constantly. And I think the authoritative voice in the poem is the voice of the woman who speaks and who is spoken about and who is written about and who is unreachable, unattainable and who remains removed from all of this.</font>	Transcription
518.558179	538.430722	<font color="navy">And backing her up, I suppose, are the women who are called the vendeurs, the sellers. And there are marketplace scenes and so forth in which the women are observed and observe others observing them. So it's a poem about representation, and a poem about the making of a series of images,</font>	Transcription
538.430722	566.259483	<font color="navy">and the whole sensual passage about the tying  of the tignon, and how important that is, and how it attaches to the free status of these particular women who are vendeurs. I think it's an important point to make that even within the free Black community there is this obsession with containment and tying and burdening.</font>	Transcription
566.51149	588.265085	<font color="navy">The difference there is that the vendeurs, these free Black women, are doing their own form of containment and tying. Their heads are tied in these sumptuous cloths. There's a passage later on in the poem that I didn't read, that talks about how they layer their ankles in gold and silver bracelets because this represents their freedom, oddly enough.</font>	Transcription
589.624122	603.669006	<font color="navy">And-- so it's a poem about the making of an image and perhaps the remaking and the reconstituting of a self against such incredible odds, I think. I could be wrong.</font>	Transcription
603.664506	619.000925	<font color="#008080">Your work, obviously, is deeply rooted in New Orleans and its history, and its African American communities. Can you speak a little bit about how you see yourself, potentially as a New Orleans poet?</font>	Transcription, Question
619.000925	641.46554	<font color="navy">I think it's the most important thing about, about the work I do is that it's, it-- it all grows out of an attempt to understand something about New Orleans. One of the things that growing up in New Orleans does is it gives you a sense of an essentially intact cultural environment.</font>	Transcription
641.46554	670.482333	<font color="navy">And of a cultural environment that is its own thing that clearly is African American, but is African American in its own rather specific, and improvised upon, and constantly improvising, way. And so I've spent most of my writing life, studying New Orleans, studying the African presence in New Orleans, studying traditional religion in New Orleans,</font>	Transcription
670.482333	698.491099	<font color="navy">as a way of understanding something about perspective, I suppose. Something about perspective, something about shape, something about how things are made. Because the poem-- I love the word poetry, the word poem. Poesis, the made thing, it is a thing that is made that is constructed that has its own entity in the world. Once it is made, it's apart from me. And it's no longer mine.</font>	Transcription
698.491099	725.095826	<font color="navy">And it stands out there, if it's any good, it stands out there on its own without me to support it. And so I think that something about New Orleans, something about the specific history of slavery endured there, something about the very specific kinds of resistance, something about our peculiar dance forms, things like the second line,</font>	Transcription
725.095826	755.552659	<font color="navy">things like hot calas, the bending of form, the recreating, and the fracturing of form, and space, and time, a kind of disbelief even in time; that history isn't the past, history is what happens. And so history is acting in us, we are acting in it, and we were acting upon it all of the time, that it's always all going on. And that's the beauty of the dance that we call second line,</font>	Transcription
755.552659	783.453422	<font color="navy">that while the primary procession is taking place, the formal procession is taking place, there are-- there's this band, or rather there are multiple bands of people gathered along the side, who are doing these other things. And each time they do the other thing, it takes a different form. Nobody dances the second line exactly the same way twice. There's certain basic steps, certain basic movements, and you do countless variations on those.</font>	Transcription
783.453422	807.034067	<font color="navy">And the beauty of the thing is that somehow we all can do it, I don't know any New Orleanians who can't do it, we all can do it. We all recognize it when we see it. And yet we all do it differently. We know what is and is not second line. But it's always changing, it's constantly changing. And-- so everything is always happening.</font>	Transcription
807.034067	829.678686	<font color="navy">And it isn't an ahistorical approach. It's probably a multi-layered approach to history as a thing from within, as opposed to a thing imposed from without. And that's the thing is that I have a fascination with history. And I have a fascination with poets who have a problem with history.</font>	Transcription
829.678686	856.643423	<font color="navy">And I think some of our greatest poets, certainly some of our greatest narrative poets have a problem with history. And that is the thing that makes-- that makes them so compelling. Robert Hayden has a problem with history, and so he writes in history, in order to work out these narrative moments and to make them real to us. Gayl Jones has a problem with history, and she's always rediscovering it and reshaping it.</font>	Transcription
856.643423	882.744137	<font color="navy">Sherley Anne Williams has a problem with history in her long narrative poems. Jay Wright has a problem with history. And so history becomes the problem. It becomes the thing that you look at, the thing that you worry, the thing that you finger. It's the scab, it's the sore, and you work around it constantly. It's always there, and it never quite goes away. It's never finished. And therefore neither are we.</font>	Transcription
882.744137	906.64879	<font color="navy">So that we're constantly working, and it isn't so much revising, as it is revisioning. That we have to learn to see history in our own image, so to speak. We have to, I think, learn and we have to teach ourselves over and over again what our history really is, and what our place is in our history, or histories.</font>	Transcription
907.0088	926.665338	<font color="#008080">So poetry in some ways it sounds like is a way of rewriting official histories, in your work. I'm wondering if the form, the long poem particularly, allows you to deal with your concerns about simultaneity of experience, multiplicity, and improvisation.</font>	Transcription, Question
926.665338	952.586047	<font color="navy">Yeah, the long narrative poem-- it seems to me the older I get the longer the poems get! The long narrative poem has become for me an ideal form. On the one hand, it's quite open, you can do all kinds of things, you can have a multitude of narrative and lyric voices happening in there. Recently, I've been experimenting with rhyme in the long poem.</font>	Transcription
952.586047	976.310695	<font color="navy">And it's an open form. And yet, at the same time, it's a form that breaks certain boundaries, in a very conscientious way. When we think of narrative, I think it's common to think of a story with a beginning, middle, and end. And yet, if you look at truly fine narrative poems, that doesn't exist in truly fine narrative, narrative poems.</font>	Transcription
976.310695	998.271296	<font color="navy">In Robert Hayden's <i>Middle Passage</i>, for instance, there is not a beginning, middle and end. We begin in the middle or at the end, we can't tell which it is, it depends on, on who's actually reading the poem. But we have snippets and passages and excerpts of things, of documents, of things that both support and critique reality.</font>	Transcription
998.271296	1030.924189	<font color="navy">And because we have all of that laid bare for us, it's like walking into a room where we have the option to rearrange everything each time we enter the room. Or perhaps each time we enter the room, we see the room as a different environment, and we organize it to suit our purposes for that moment. So that the poem exists in a kind of moment that is that moment at that time.</font>	Transcription
1031.248197	1040.320445	<font color="#008080">So then the poem exists-- or does it create then a whole? Or is it another type of representation of a fragmentation?</font>	Transcription, Question
1040.320445	1070.021258	<font color="navy">I wonder that there are these wholes that we constantly seek out. I wonder. I was raised in a tradition that believes very much in whole, in the whole in the beauty of the whole. That a thing is good when it is beautiful, a thing is beautiful when it is whole, that wholeness and beauty and health all go together, that those are all the same thing. And so on the one hand I was brought up in a tradition that, that holds very dearly to that principle.</font>	Transcription
1070.021258	1086.509708	<font color="navy">And yet at the same time, the poems that I write are by nature fragmentary, and purposely fragmenting the scene, or the character, or the speaker, or the narrative, or the image.</font>	Transcription
1086.509708	1112.430417	<font color="navy">There are lots of images of broken things, and sometimes stanzas seem to end at a point where nothing has actually happened. Something might be about to happen. But we don't know yet what that is, and we don't find out in that poem. So that we get bits and pieces. And the thing is, it isn't the story that's important, it is the thing that eventually, we begin to realize as readers.</font>	Transcription
1112.430417	1128.594859	<font color="navy">It isn't the story that matters in the narrative poem, it's how the story is being told, why the story is being told. And who are the voices telling these stories? And do we trust them? Do we know them? Are they us?</font>	Transcription
1129.926896	1154.551569	<font color="navy">So it's, it's, it's about possibilities, I think, much more so than about, than about the story itself. And I think that's a major difference between the writing of prose fiction, and the writing of the narrative poem, that the purpose is different. My purpose is never to tell a story when I start out.</font>	Transcription
1154.551569	1179.968264	<font color="navy">What happens is that I come across a story, I find a story, or a story finds me, and I find it compelling in some way, and try to see how many ways I can approach that story, and how many versions or voices that story might exist in. And sometimes within the same character, within the same narrative, within the same narrator, there might be multiple voices going on, so.</font>	Transcription
1179.968264	1193.144624	<font color="#008080">And in terms of the larger picture of African American poetry, do you have a sense of yourself as a part of a movement or part of a contemporary sensibility?</font>	Transcription, Question
1193.144624	1217.985303	<font color="navy">A part of a movement, I would say probably not, in all honesty, probably not. I started publishing in the late 1970s, and I certainly have some major influences and some major references, I think.</font>	Transcription
1217.985303	1241.025933	<font color="navy">But I've never, I've never been a joiner. And so I've never seen my work as belonging to a particular movement. I do see that it belongs in a certain moment, though. But those are really questions, I suppose, to be determined later, after the passage of much time.</font>	Transcription
1241.025933	1264.246568	<font color="navy">But I do see African American poetry attempting to acquire a new freshness, a new kind of experimentation with language that is perhaps not quite so reverent as it once was, that there is a newly awakened sense of play,</font>	Transcription
1264.246568	1283.147085	<font color="navy">and a newly awakened sense of-- and when I talk about play, I'm talking about taking a kind of joy in the language and seeing the language as the instrument that it is. So that there is not such an awe of the beauty of language, that we can also toy with the ugliness of language.</font>	Transcription
1283.147085	1312.127877	<font color="navy">And that we can represent horrible things in beautiful language is one of the most shocking, one of the most shocking things. I think it happens in prose fiction quite a lot as well. There's that beautiful passage in Toni Morrison's Beloved where Sethe is attempting to behead her child because the slavers are coming. And it's one of the most beautiful passages, I think, in the English language.</font>	Transcription
1312.127877	1333.620465	<font color="navy">And there is a kind of holy, quiet, that surrounds that moment. That's the moment of poetry. That's the stuff that we that we hold to and cling to, and embrace. And yet the act is so horrible, that we are able to see a kind of beauty in it.</font>	Transcription
1333.620465	1351.872964	<font color="#008080">Holy quiet. That's a lovely phrase. I'm thinking about your knowledge of language, and languages, and I'm wondering how being fluent in several languages influences your own work, and your understanding of the complexities of language and meaning.</font>	Transcription
1351.872964	1366.381361	<font color="navy">I would say I have an obsession with language and languages and, and that I collect language and languages, I suppose, in the way that other people collect objects.</font>	Transcription
1367.46139	1389.493993	<font color="navy">And it goes back pretty far, I suppose. I've always had a fascination with language and with languages, because something tells me that, that there's always something in there, there's always some possibility in there. And of course, there are things that we can express in certain languages that we can't express in other languages there-- finally, there are things that are that are non-translatable.</font>	Transcription
1390.898031	1418.474785	<font color="navy">There's no French word for gumbo. Because the concept doesn't exist, because the experience doesn't exist, because the ingredients don't exist. So you make it as best you possibly can in this other environment, but you have to call it gumbo. That's what it is. And... and yet there's a layering that takes place there. There's a layering of experience, and a layering of language.</font>	Transcription
1418.474785	1450.623664	<font color="navy">And one of the things that fascinates me about Black folk, wherever we find them is the extent to which we have always joyed in language. We're a tongue people. We believe in loose tongues and free tongues. And one of the things that I think it's very easy to forget nowadays with the 21st century, one of the things that's very easy to forget, is that we came to the new world as a multilingual people.</font>	Transcription
1450.623664	1470.640212	<font color="navy">And we perhaps lost or discarded languages along the way. And I think there's a kind of imperative that we make some attempt to reclaim some of those languages, as best we possibly can. And to embrace language.</font>	Transcription
1471.828244	1500.665033	<font color="navy">And language is one of those things that's, of course, always been used against us as a tool, as a weapon. And it's the kind of thing that we've always embraced and said-- a perfect example of that is Creole language. You take the masters' language, which might be French or Spanish or Portuguese or Dutch. And you say this is your language. This is the language of the master. This is the language in which you control me. This is the language in which you turn me into an abject object. This is the language in which you denigrate me.</font>	Transcription
1500.665033	1523.165648	<font color="navy">I will show you what I can do with your language, I will give it back to you in this fractured, twisted form. And you tell me, can you understand what I'm doing with this language now? Can you speak this language. And of course, the reality is that you find very few people who are not born into a creole speaking environment, who speak those languages and understand those languages.</font>	Transcription
1523.165648	1539.042082	<font color="navy">And even when we translate those languages into our use of English, which certainly is what happens in a place like Louisiana, you find us coming up with these newly concocted arrangements of language and turn, turns of phrase,</font>	Transcription
1539.042082	1570.43494	<font color="navy">and, and that's the thing I think, where we find beauty in the language is it's the turn of phrase. It isn't the funny spellings of, of plantation dialect. And poets who use Black folk speech, we're never really trying to do plantation dialect that was imposed from the exterior. They were trying to capture the authenticity of Black skill: the ability to improvise and to make language, to make words.</font>	Transcription
1570.43494	1599.883746	<font color="navy">And finally, that's what poetry is really all about. More so I think than all of the other literary art forms, poetry is lodged in language, and you have to go through the language-- there is no other way. If it doesn't exist in the poem, if it doesn't exist in the text, then it ain't there. And you can't, you can't put it there, you have to enter the poem through the language. And part of what that means is that you have to be able to enter the poet's world.</font>	Transcription
1599.883746	1615.04016	<font color="#008080">And is that-- entering the poet's world, minority poets or African American poets-- do you find that that's a particularly difficult thing for audiences to do, or how do you negotiate that gap as a poet?</font>	Transcription, Question
1615.184164	1645.208985	<font color="navy">It's less difficult for audiences to do it I think, than for academics and critics to do. Because, again, academics and critics frequently are imposing an external structure. And the difference that we see is--  I think it's best illustrated when we look at the difference in audience response at a live poetry reading, and the dearth of criticism and critical study of African American poetry.</font>	Transcription
1647.369044	1674.405783	<font color="navy">Huge gap, there's a huge gap there. The audience listening to the poem, seeing the poem, hearing the poem being performed, understands the poem, grasps the poem, responds to the poem in the moment. And that's a wonderful thing to be a part of. One of the best things about poetry is the live poetry reading. Because there's a kind of energy that takes place, there's something that passes between the poet and the audience, when it's working.</font>	Transcription
1674.405783	1698.850452	<font color="navy">When everything is going well, there's this energy that passes back and forth between the poet and the audience. And we feed on that, it's a mutual thing. That doesn't necessarily happen with the critic. It doesn't necessarily happen. Because there's this attempt to impose this order from outside. And one of the things that the poet, of course wants to do is to break the rules, and to destroy the order, and perhaps to create a new order.</font>	Transcription
1698.850452	1712.67483	<font color="#008080">Well, I mean we were talking about the importance of performance, it sounds to me, in terms of your own work and energy that you derive from audiences. How would you distinguish what you do in poetry reading from spoken word poetry [inaudible]?</font>	Transcription, Question
1712.67483	1734.779434	<font color="navy">I think it's quite different. I could be very wrong about this, but spoken word seems to me to involve a truly theatrical bent, and intent. I think what happens when I'm reading, I'm trying to read well,</font>	Transcription
1735.35545	1758.612086	<font color="navy">I'm trying to read the poem in the voices that are speaking in the poem whether there are narrators functioning as actual narrators or not, and that's quite different. And I think what happens also is that there is the ability to improvise, it's not that I'm reading words that aren't on the page, or that I'm leaving out words that are on the page.</font>	Transcription
1758.792091	1782.588741	<font color="navy">But each reading of the poem is going to be different than every other reading of the poem, a poem like the Nina Simone poem-- there are occasions where I will read it with more or less verve, with more or less bounce, with more or less volume, with more or less emphasis on certain lines, phrases, stanzas.</font>	Transcription
1782.588741	1800.517231	<font color="navy">And that happens-- very, much of that happens in the moment when the poet realizes who that audience is and what that response is like, and so it becomes a kind of a wave that you ride.</font>	Transcription
1800.517231	1807.249416	<font color="#008080">And you're saying to come back to that idea of improvisation?</dark>	Transcription, Question
1803.0373	1803.577315	<font color="navy">Mmhmm.</font>	Transcription
1803.577315	1807.249416	<font color="#008080">And what are you working on now [inaudible] projects?</font>	Transcription, Question
1807.249416	1825.573917	<font color="navy">Lots of things. I'm working on lots of things. I'm working on a series of essays about my experiences in France, going back to France after more than 20 years, 30-some years, 30 years I guess.</font>	Transcription
1826.005928	1851.926637	<font color="navy">I did my undergrad as-- part of my undergraduate studies I did in France and returned to the southern region for six months to work on a new book project that's a bilingual French-English (smattering of Creole), project about slavery and resistance in Louisiana under the French colonial regime. So that's one project, and then there are two other poetry manuscripts.</font>	Transcription
1852.214645	1873.455226	<font color="navy">Also having to do with Louisiana with New Orleans as a topic. But one of them does a lot of experimentation with rhyme, which I've never used, or never used to great effect before. I also write creative nonfiction. So there's a body of essays that I'm working on right now.</font>	Transcription
1873.455226	1899.015925	<font color="navy">And then there is a series of, I guess, for lack of a better word, dispatches about my experiences returning to France after all of those years, looking at French racism, which not only has not improved in the past 30 years, but has intensified and worsened in rather graphic ways.</font>	Transcription
1899.015925	1918.168448	<font color="navy">And so there're always a number of projects going on when, when I'm working well, I'm working on a number of projects. Because just because one thing isn't going well, at one moment, doesn't mean that I can't work on something else. So there's always something, some iron in the fire.</font>	Transcription
1919.032472	1945.133186	<font color="#008080">The way that you're speaking of your experiences in France and New Orleans, it seems to me that you've constructed yourself in feeling as if you're a person with multiple influences and multiple identities in terms of your heritage. And I'm wondering how the label of African American either fits that description or fits your self-- your self-structure or in some ways may even be limiting?</font>	Transcription, Question
1945.133186	1977.318066	<font color="navy">I think it fits perfectly, I think it's-- I think it's about as precise and as exact as we can get. I really think it is because it means a lot of different things at the same time. Of course, historically, we're an African people in the Americas. And there're so many versions and variations of that. And of course, there's a tendency to think of African American as a monolith, which of course, it never is, never was.</font>	Transcription
1977.318066	1995.462562	<font color="navy">And there has been a tendency sometimes on the part of critics looking at my work to say, well, this is not, this is not African American, this is not Black, this is New Orleans. And, and while New Orleans certainly is its own space, its own culture, that space and that culture have always been Black space.</font>	Transcription
1995.462562	2025.451382	<font color="navy">And so it's one of those-- one of the things that I always say is that when we make those kinds of distinctions, that slavery under the French was better or slavery under the Spaniards was better or slavery under the British-- my slave master's better than your slave master never made any sense to me at all. We're talking about different experiences, we're talking about different cultural influences, we're talking about different, different approaches to acquiring and claiming freedom.</font>	Transcription
2025.451382	2052.956134	<font color="navy">And a lot of that stuff is contained in language. And in part, there's a very practical side to that a lot of that is contained in language, because law is written in language. And so once you have the black codes promulgated in the French Caribbean, and later in Louisiana, that sets the tone for how freedom will be denied and claimed and bartered against.</font>	Transcription
2052.956134	2081.792922	<font color="navy">And so certainly African American, I think entirely fits who I am and what I do. But the other thing that I think is that when we look at the Americas, in the broader sense, the things that we single out, as having uniquely to do with the Americas, as opposed to those things having to do with Europe, those things having to do with Africa,</font>	Transcription
2081.792922	2099.145397	<font color="navy">what we're looking at is the influence of people of African descent in the new world. And I don't think we yet realize the hugeness of that reality. I don't think we yet understand what that means.</font>	Transcription
2099.325402	2124.922102	<font color="navy">When ever American culture is transported, what is transported and what is received is something that is Black in its origins. And that's something that I think we need to be very clear about stating and laying claim to and making clear for ourselves, because I think we often are not aware of the extent of our influence in the culture.</font> 	Transcription
2124.922102	2154.874921	<font color="navy">And I think in part, it's because the United States in particular is such a large space geographically, and such a broad space culturally, that it's easy for us not to look beyond the boundaries of the 48 states. But once we step outside of that, and we begin to look at cultures across the world, things begin to make much more sense to us. And our role in the world begins to make much more sense to us.</font>	Transcription
2154.874921	2179.895605	<font color="navy">And how we are depicted and represented, and how we are written about and spoken about, and how we claim the language and languages in which we will write about our own selves, and our own experiences-- those are the things that actually signify America and the Americas in terms of culture, and in terms of cultural transmissions.</font>	Transcription
2179.895605	2205.420303	<font color="navy">And I think that, maybe it's a little bit easier for poets to be aware of that, because I think poets may have a tendency to read across genres and across languages, much more so than other folk, it isn't uncommon for poets to read bilingually, trilingually, or at least to work with bilingual texts. It isn't-- it isn't as unusual perhaps for us to do that.</font>	Transcription
2206.932344	2230.404986	<font color="navy">And to work with translators of our work. It isn't uncommon that translations of prose fiction occur without any participation by the author. It's somewhat rare that such translations occur without the participation of the poet. That's somewhat rare, actually.</font>	Transcription
2230.404986	2232.961056	<font color="#008080">Getting a [inaudible] is like being a sort of [inaudible] poetry.</font>	Transcription
2232.277037	2246.893437	<font color="navy">It really is, it really is, and  deciding what remains in the original language, and what gets translated becomes the tricky part. And that's finally how we determine what is or is not a good translation of a poem. </font>	Transcription
2248.297475	2248.909492	<font color="#008080">In terms--</font>	Transcription
2248.909492	2251.177554	I think, one short question. 	Transcription
2251.177554	2251.825572	<font color="#008080">Okay</font>	Transcription
2251.825572	2253.841627	A Short question with a shorter answer.	Transcription
2255.101661	2262.01385	<font color="#008080">Just to conclude, what directions do you see African or American poetry going in the 21st century?</font>	Transcription, Question
2262.01385	2288.33057	<font color="navy">I think that we're in a place now, where African American poetry in the 21st century is the vanguard. And I think we're maybe not quite aware of that. But African American poetry in the 20th century really is the vanguard, and frankly, always has been the cutting edge for what was happening in poetry in this society.</font>	Transcription
2288.33057	2312.307225	<font color="navy">That we were the modernizers of language in the 1910s and 20s. We brought jazz into written art. We transformed language, we brought in the vernacular, we remade the American language. It is as much ours perhaps more ours than any other group.</font>	Transcription
2313.171249	2316.303335	<font color="#008080">Well thank you so much for your time.</font>	Transcription
2316.591342	2323.179523	Excellent. Thank you! You guys need more time. We need more tape!	Transcription
2323.179523	2332.791785	Oh oh, don't move yet. We're just gonna get 30 seconds of tape, okay. If you guys could just have any kind of conversation, just don't all talk at once [inaudible].	Transcription
2332.791785	2335.203851	<font color="#008080">So, you're taking off tomorrow, right?</font>	Transcription, Question
2335.203851	2342.260044	<font color="navy">Yep, yep. I get back home tomorrow. This has been really really good. [Inaudible]</font>	Transcription
