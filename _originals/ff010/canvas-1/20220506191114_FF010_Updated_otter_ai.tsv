0.091	20.85	<font color='#008080'>--terms of testifying. So part of what we will do today, is for you all to testify to what you know, about Furious Flower, how many ways you&#39;ve entered this whole phenomenon  that&#39;s</font>	Transcription
20.851	27.99	<font color='#008080'>called Furious Flower. So that&#39;s how we&#39;re going to involve all the voices in this room.</font>	Transcription
29.761	50.19	<font color='#008080'>And the subtext, I think, for this workshop for this seminar is... you will teach what you know. Isn&#39;t that the, isn&#39;t that the reason we are doing this legacy? I started calling this this legacy</font>	Transcription
50.671	51.3	<font color='#008080'>seminar.</font>	Transcription
52.081	77.73	<font color='#008080'>Because if we learn about Sonia Sanchez&#39;s work, and we are comfortable with it -- we appreciate it -- we will teach it. The reason Sonia in 1965, had to mimeograph Black authors is that there were no</font>	Transcription
77.731	83.28	<font color='#008080'>texts for these authors when she taught at San Francisco State.</font>	Transcription
84.121	101.13	<font color='#008080'>I&#39;ve heard you tell that story many times. And um, but, she realized when she started, that these authors must be taught. And the only way that they were going to be taught is that she was going to</font>	Transcription
101.131	112.29	<font color='#008080'>teach them. And then she realized that if she didn&#39;t start a Black Studies program, that when she left, it would be like a black hole again.</font>	Transcription
113.311	137.43	<font color='#008080'>So, I really believe that you teach what you know. And when I came to James Madison University, in 1985, I was the first African American to be hired in the department.</font>	Transcription
138.541	154.59	<font color='#008080'>Now, I didn&#39;t learn until later that there was great resentment about my hiring. And Azadi, you had a, a laugh of recognition there. It&#39;s like you had a little white handkerchief and you said: I know</font>	Transcription
154.591	155.43	<font color='#008080'>what you talkin about.</font>	Transcription
156.621	176.24	<font color='#008080'>And that&#39;s how it was, for so many Black women and men coming into academe in the late &#39;70s and &#39;80s. In fact, I was sharing with Sonia and Azadi and Becky at lunch,</font>	Transcription
177.021	200.51	<font color='#008080'>that when my first departmental meeting, and I&#39;d been I was at JMU for just a week, maybe two weeks at the most. I go into the meeting, and I get there early, so that people will know that I&#39;m going</font>	Transcription
200.511	204.29	<font color='#008080'>to be a functioning part of this department.</font>	Transcription
205.731	227.54	<font color='#008080'>So I come in and take my seat in the second to the last row. And in comes this man, my colleagues, smelling of cigarette smoke, and bourbon. He just happened to be the Southern Literature specialist.</font>	Transcription
227.001	246.47	<font color='#008080'>I&#39;ll never forget his name, David Hallman. I&#39;ll put it out there. I&#39;ll put it out there, because, you know, let&#39;s call a spade a spade. So I&#39;m sitting there waiting for the meeting to begin. He comes</font>	Transcription
246.471	250.46	<font color='#008080'>in trailing faculty members.</font>	Transcription
252.651	260.57	<font color='#008080'>And he comes and sits behind me. And he says to them, &quot;come on back here to the Jim Crow section.&quot;</font>	Transcription

283.581	290.06	<font color='#008080'>we had a year to decide and I&#39;m now here for only two weeks. My husband&#39;s having a great experience.</font>	Transcription
291.261	309.86	<font color='#008080'>So I bit my lip and I said, oh my god, what have I come into? ...Well... the meeting was about to begin. And other people were coming in, just as you all were just coming in. And then he said to them,</font>	Transcription

333.861	352.52	<font color='#008080'>So that was my first week at James Madison University. Now, obviously, things have gotten better. But that was my introduction, and why, why was this man allowed to do this? And do you know, how do</font>	Transcription

364.691	383.02	<font color='#008080'>What? No one said a word. Well, when he said that, to me, my stomach started churning. And I said, if I don&#39;t respond immediately to this, that I did not hold my head up in this</font>	Transcription

408.571	424.83	<font color='#008080'>And I meant it. Because I was really, really sure that it was going to be physical. If I had to deal with this again. And the thing that made me angry, I have been, since I&#39;ve been a teacher, and I</font>	Transcription

432.541	451.68	<font color='#008080'>And I thought, if this man who is honored by his colleagues, has this kind of latitude with a colleague, someone who&#39;s a peer, what is he doing inside the classroom with students? So that, it made me</font>	Transcription

595.411	617.73	<font color='#008080'>Already, people are telling me that Furious Flower has not only taken on the, I suppose the heft of an institution, but it&#39;s taken on the aura of a kind of movement. We sort of started something,</font>	Transcription

817.361	833.98	<font color='#008080'>Yes, that&#39;s exactly right. In 1993, a year before the conference materialized. Gwen Brooks came to Virginia. And this was her second visit to Virginia during my time here,</font>	Transcription
834.251	852.82	<font color='#008080'>I always said, from the time that I went to Roosevelt University to teach, that I would invite Gwendolyn Brooks to every school that I taught at. And I did that because, when I got to Roosevelt</font>	Transcription
852.821	855.91	<font color='#008080'>University in Chicago, my very first teaching gig,</font>	Transcription
857.081	868.0	<font color='#008080'>one of my colleagues told me that, you know, we could have had Gwendolyn Brooks here. But the faculty turned her down. And I said, What?</font>	Transcription
871.871	892.75	<font color='#008080'>This was in 1971. I am green, out of the University of Chicago with a Master&#39;s degree. Gwendolyn Brooks, in 1950, when I was four years old, had gotten a Pulitzer Prize for poetry... and she couldn&#39;t</font>	Transcription
892.751	895.27	<font color='#008080'>teach at Roosevelt University?</font>	Transcription
897.071	916.57	<font color='#008080'>You have to know the story of how we have broken down walls. So you can appreciate where you are now, but also have the honor to go on and get in there and fight for your students. So she came to</font>	Transcription
917.111	922.96	<font color='#008080'>James Madison in 1986. And she came back to the area in 1993.</font>	Transcription
923.321	936.64	<font color='#008080'>When she came back, I said, to Gwen, I said, Gwen, you&#39;re gonna have to come over to JMU, again, and speak, she says, Well, I was just here. She said, I won&#39;t come this year, but I&#39;ll come next year.</font>	Transcription
937.481	944.2	<font color='#008080'>So I had a whole year to plan for her reading, which was going to be just the reading.</font>	Transcription
945.251	956.71	<font color='#008080'>I started telling people, you know, Gwendolyn Brooks is coming to campus, would you like to come and be there with her while she reads? And they said, you know, we not only want to be there, but we</font>	Transcription
956.711	969.73	<font color='#008080'>want to honor her by reading with her. And so what started with one reader, ended up being, what, 35 invited poets, and then another 50 or so just came.</font>	Transcription
969.001	991.11	<font color='#008080'>And so that was 1994. So Furious Flower, gets its title from Gwendolyn Brooks&#39; poem, <i>Second Sermon on the Warpland</i>. And the line&#39;s: &quot;The time/ cracks into furious flower. Lifts it&#39;s face/ all</font>	Transcription
991.111	994.17	<font color='#008080'>unashamed. And sways in wicked grace.&quot;</font>	Transcription
995.221	1014.6	<font color='#008080'>So by the time I started trying to come up with a title for this gathering, it was now about more than Gwendolyn Brooks. Furious Flower was Gwendolyn Brooks. But it was also the period that she was a</font>	Transcription
1014.601	1019.61	<font color='#008080'>part of. It was the period from 1950, forward.</font>	Transcription
1020.751	1035.66	<font color='#008080'>And so these were the poets that came out in large numbers to help honor her. And it was just a magnificent, magnificent conf- I never expected to do it again.</font>	Transcription
1036.921	1048.41	<font color='#008080'>In fact, I called my friend Sonia, and I said, Sonia I have all of these people talking about, (after it was over), talking about you have to do that again, that was wonderful. And that was about</font>	Transcription
1048.411	1058.49	<font color='#008080'>three or four years in. And so Sonia said to me, she said, Well you know, something this big, you can&#39;t do it every five years. You gotta wait, you remember?</font>	Transcription

1061.551	1071.24	<font color='#008080'>And so I didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t do it. And then some of the younger poets started saying, we heard so much about Furious Flower, when are you going to do this --</font>	Transcription
1071.24	1073.13	<font color='navy'><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>	Speaker

1089.601	1092.81	<font color='#008080'>the next Furious Flower conference happened.</font>	Transcription
1093.861	1113.93	<font color='#008080'>And the outpouring for that conference was amazing. So we had 50 invited poets. And at each point, Sonia Sanchez was there with me to do Furious Flower. She was there to read on the opening night, on</font>	Transcription

1146.331	1162.08	<font color='#008080'>Yeah, that&#39;s right. Okay. So those videos, I realized that a lot of schools would not have the resources, or the wherewithal to bring Sonia to their school. So if they can go and get</font>	Transcription
1162.081	1169.7	<font color='#008080'>a clip of Sonia talking about her work, hear, her reading her poems, then that would be second best.</font>	Transcription
1170.271	1187.94	<font color='#008080'>And so we did those videos and I love that we came up with the titles, Elders, Warriors, Seers, Initiates. Because there were four generations of poets at the first conference. At the second</font>	Transcription

1232.491	1246.8	<font color='NONE'>I think Baraka was on stage, and he said something about Gates, And some people-- it wasn&#39;t only Ellis but I was sitting near him-- some people in the audience kind of took umbrage and got noisy, and</font>	Transcription

1264.23	1278.78	<font color='darkgoldenrod'><b>Opal Moore</b></font>	Speaker
1264.231	1278.78	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>So I got a telephone call from Joanne one morning. She was on her way to the president&#39;s office, because a group of students were organizing, reportedly organizing a protest against Amiri</font>	Transcription
1278.811	1288.77	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>Baraka being invited to the second Furious Flower. So, Joanne, just, had to--</font>	Transcription

1288.801	1290.3	<font color='#008080'>Because of the poem.</font>	Transcription
1290.3	1294.05	<font color='darkgoldenrod'><b>Opal Moore</b></font>	Speaker
1290.301	1294.05	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>Because of the poem, because of the poem he wrote, following 9/11</font>	Transcription
1294.05	1295.34	<font color='#008080'><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>	Speaker
1294.051	1295.34	<font color='#008080'><i>Somebody Blew up America</i>.</font>	Transcription

1296.541	1313.52	<font color='darkgoldenrod'><i>Somebody Blew up America</i>. So the students, of course, I think it was, for them to do that. But what was interesting, and what I think, is powerful in the story is that Joanne, of</font>	Transcription
1313.521	1319.58	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>course, knew that she was not going to retract the invitation to Amiri Baraka. So that was understood.</font>	Transcription
1320.451	1340.13	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>But she was thinking through the ways, being both a Professor, being herself, being a poet, being a teacher, and also being a member of a variety of communities, she was thinking about the ways that</font>	Transcription
1340.131	1349.43	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>she would make it clear that while the students&#39; protests could take place, that Amiri Baraka would be coming.</font>	Transcription
1349.691	1363.07	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>So I remember that she and I, I know that you called [inaudible] before  you went to meet the president, to talk about what kind of understanding should we bring to the situation. So, so I know that</font>	Transcription
1363.071	1374.98	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>the controversy then was on the campus, but what was interesting was that when Amiri Baraka came and presented, there were-- I was in that audience and I noticed that certain, certain people refused</font>	Transcription
1374.981	1378.82	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>to stand when, and participate in his standing ovation.</font>	Transcription
1380.111	1395.05	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>But the house stood for Amiri Baraka. I noted a number of people (of course I couldn&#39;t have known them), but I noted a number of people who sat. Very pointedly not standing. So that was a very</font>	Transcription
1395.051	1406.42	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>important point of contention around the right of a poet to speak, the right of Amiri Baraka to tell the story that he needed to tell, through that poem and other poems,</font>	Transcription
1407.531	1421.75	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>but also, the right for students to engage in a conversation and a discussion around something that they thought they needed to speak about. And then, the other part is the magazine article that</font>	Transcription
1421.751	1427.18	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>followed, where a number of voices were published around this issue.</font>	Transcription
1427.541	1440.41	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>And so I think that all of these things, I mean, in terms of talking about a teaching tool, even some of the sidebar information that surrounds these kinds of conferences are very useful teaching</font>	Transcription
1440.411	1451.3	<font color='darkgoldenrod'>tools, just around poetry, around, around freedom of speech, around truth-telling. And, and also I would say, around doing your homework if you&#39;re gonna protest something.</font>	Transcription

1451.331	1472.72	<font color='#008080'>Yeah, exactly. Well, you know, I was very fortunate to have amazing mentors. And Gwendolyn Brooks was a mentor. Margaret Walker was a mentor. Sonia Sanchez, my sister, and I remember</font>	Transcription
1472.931	1477.1	<font color='#008080'>the, the year I came to James Madison University.</font>	Transcription
1478.811	1499.78	<font color='#008080'>I had just gotten here. And Sonia called me and she was screaming on the telephone. And she was screaming because police in Philadelphia had dropped bombs on MOVE.</font>	Transcription

1510.961	1525.78	<font color='#008080'>May, okay. May, okay. It was just before I came, I knew we were coming. Our furniture was already going to be moved. I was just getting ready to go to Virginia. And, you know, when</font>	Transcription
1525.781	1535.35	<font color='#008080'>you, when something like that happens, and when you understand that authorities can make you do a lot if you are scared.</font>	Transcription
1536.611	1551.64	<font color='#008080'>But I had such peace. I called my Wintergreen sisters, I had such peace about what I was going to do. This was just a month before the conference was supposed to happen. It was in August that this</font>	Transcription
1551.641	1556.56	<font color='#008080'>controversy started. It was to honor Sonia and Amiri.</font>	Transcription
1558.031	1573.06	<font color='#008080'>I made up in my mind that if the president would ask me to disinvite Amiri  Baraka, then I would call the entire conference off.</font>	Transcription
1575.071	1588.6	<font color='#008080'>And, that would have been a rough call, but it would&#39;ve been the the only call I could have made. And that&#39;s why I wanted support, I wanted to hear people talk about what they thought, but I made up</font>	Transcription
1588.601	1594.81	<font color='#008080'>in my mind that if you have any principle, you have to stand on principle.</font>	Transcription
1594.001	1615.18	<font color='#008080'>Why? If they can ask me to disinvite Amiri Baraka, because of a poem-- <i>Somebody Blew up America</i>-- then they can ask me to disinvite Nicki Giovanni because of her poems, written in the 1960s, or</font>	Transcription
1615.181	1619.8	<font color='#008080'>Sonia&#39;s poems, or Rita Dove&#39;s poems.</font>	Transcription
1620.371	1634.14	<font color='#008080'>If you find something that you don&#39;t like, about their political point of view, then no one is safe, and so I was not going to do that. So I was gonna make-- even though we have put in a year&#39;s worth</font>	Transcription
1634.141	1634.59	<font color='#008080'>of work.</font>	Transcription
1635.761	1650.34	<font color='#008080'>And so that&#39;s a sidebar. But that&#39;s an important one. It&#39;s an important one, because you in your own careers will have to make decisions that are tough decisions. And they will have to do, be based on</font>	Transcription
1650.371	1656.64	<font color='#008080'>principles that you hold dear. And if you sell out on one principle, you&#39;ll sell out on all of them. Yeah, go on, [inaudible]</font>	Transcription

1753.441	1767.09	<font color='NONE'>I think that it&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;ve done that. I was trying to convince my school to buy, well, the first tapes. And then when I went online, and I teach strictly online, it</font>	Transcription
1767.091	1778.73	<font color='NONE'>didn&#39;t become a pressing issue for me because it was only for my selfish needs. You know, the faculty, what they needed. But now, I can use the website as part of my class instead of directing them</font>	Transcription
1778.821	1781.88	<font color='NONE'>right to Youtube, to find clips. It&#39;s very helpful.</font>	Transcription

1781.001	1796.84	<font color='#008080'>That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. So those conferences are available, now on the internet, as well as from California Newsreel. In California Newsreel, you have the conversations that you</font>	Transcription
1796.841	1805.24	<font color='#008080'>will not find between the poet&#39;s and other poets or critics, and you have their readings, which are invaluable.</font>	Transcription
1805.331	1824.68	<font color='#008080'>So just listen to the people who are on the DVD for 2004. Sonia Sanchez, Rita Dove, Amiri Baraka, Lucille Clifton, Askia Tour??, Haki Madhubuti, just to name a few. They are, they&#39;re there. But there</font>	Transcription
1824.681	1827.26	<font color='#008080'>were 25, there are 25 on here.</font>	Transcription
1828.041	1849.58	<font color='#008080'>Okay, fast forward. After 2004 and that conference Linwood Rose, realized that we had something going here. And I still directed the Honors Program. Working on this, these conferences on the side, I</font>	Transcription
1849.581	1854.65	<font color='#008080'>still had a full time job teaching my courses. But on the side, I put together these conferences.</font>	Transcription
1856.871	1876.01	<font color='#008080'>I decided that, okay, we could have a center. And I went to him with a proposal. And he, in his infinite wisdom, decided to give us about $100,000 to start the Furious Flower Poetry Center.</font>	Transcription
1876.001	1888.6	<font color='#008080'>As I said, things have changed. I had the support of the first President Ronald Carrier for the first conference. For the second conference, I had the support of the president, President Linwood Rose.</font>	Transcription
1889.501	1904.8	<font color='#008080'>In fact, just a footnote, to that story about Amiri Baraka. Dr. Rose decided, if there was only one event that he was going to go to, it was going to be the reading of Amiri Baraka. And he went to</font>	Transcription
1904.801	1913.92	<font color='#008080'>that reading, and he sent me an email afterwards and said, what was the big deal? He didn&#39;t hear anything that he was offended by.</font>	Transcription
1914.111	1936.79	<font color='#008080'>Now talk about historical vindication. Who comes out with an entire book about what was known before 9/11? In the Congressional Record. So if we, if we silence our-- if we allow our poets to be</font>	Transcription
1936.791	1939.58	<font color='#008080'>silenced, we will live in a very dangerous world.</font>	Transcription

1941.59	1952.24	<font color='navy'><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>	Speaker
1941.591	1952.24	<font color='navy'>And as an aside, if you allow the younger poets to disrespect the elder poets then there&#39;d be danger to society and that should be noted, finally, as an aside, only as an element I&#39;m</font>	Transcription
1952.241	1964.33	<font color='navy'>saying it. you know, at some point, it has got to be addressed. You could disagree with what Baraka says, but you don&#39;t disrespect the elder. And I watched people, the younger poets disrespect him,</font>	Transcription
1964.811	1976.0	<font color='navy'>You know, and I almost got up and said something, then I said no it&#39;s Joanne&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s been enough uproar here already. But send a sign as teachers, you know, and professors, that you really</font>	Transcription
1976.001	1987.16	<font color='navy'>have got to insist, you know, at some point, that you can come on a different level of how you write and why you write and what you&#39;re about, you know, and you&#39;re not political, but-- and etcetera.</font>	Transcription
1987.401	1999.79	<font color='navy'>But still, you know, we disagreed with some of the older poets. I mean, I know, I was, I&#39;ll never forget, and I told you about this, I got a long letter about... three letters, from different</font>	Transcription
1999.791	2007.32	<font color='navy'>departments about people who were up for tenure. The people who wrote it knew that we were completely different politically.</font>	Transcription
2007.801	2017.73	<font color='navy'>Now you have to hear that. And I got these letters, you know, and the calls saying we&#39;d like you to write a recommendation, bla bla bla bla bla. And I said, certainly, so I wrote the recommendation,</font>	Transcription
2018.031	2028.8	<font color='navy'>positive [inaudible]. And then I got a call that said Oh, you wrote a positive recommendation, they expected me to blast the person. No, we got to hear this. Because I&#39;m saying to you young people,</font>	Transcription
2028.801	2035.16	<font color='navy'>you cannot blast people you disagree with. You cannot do it, you know, it is immoral to do it.</font>	Transcription
2036.121	2047.97	<font color='navy'>It is immoral. I don&#39;t care what, I don&#39;t like her, I don&#39;t like him. No, no, no, no, no. That person has a right to have a tenured position just as you have a right, you cannot do that.</font>	Transcription
2048.181	2060.63	<font color='navy'>And that&#39;s the thing that, as an aside, a major aside that I&#39;d like to see us talk about is that sometimes you know how we allow that kind of, opinion of people to have-- and people write terrible</font>	Transcription
2060.691	2069.18	<font color='navy'>recommendations. I&#39;ve read that myself, about people you know, they don&#39;t know I&#39;ve read them, and then I look and say how can you do that to another human being.</font>	Transcription
2069.541	2082.05	<font color='navy'>And I think that&#39;s important, you know, and so one was Gloria Oden. I don&#39;t know if you remember Gloria Oden the poet. You know, she was in Maryland. I get it. But we want you to write this whatever.</font>	Transcription
2082.411	2087.81	<font color='navy'>They knew that Gloria has said some things about the younger poets, you know, me and my group at the time.</font>	Transcription
2088.141	2097.35	<font color='navy'>And I wrote her, you know, she was being in quotes &quot;promoted and getting this forever&quot;. I wrote a glowing, recommendation, and they actually called me and said, well. Did you understand that she was</font>	Transcription
2097.351	2108.48	<font color='navy'>up? --I said, oh yes, yes I did, isn&#39;t that wonderful that she&#39;ll get it. That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about, that kind of reality. When people write to you thinking you don&#39;t like her, you&#39;re going to</font>	Transcription
2108.541	2112.05	<font color='navy'>perform an immoral act by not supporting her or him.</font>	Transcription
2112.441	2123.9	<font color='navy'>And I&#39;m saying to you as younger professors you can&#39;t do it, you cannot do it, you must not do it. Because when you do that you commit an immoral act and have said simply, that we are still separate</font>	Transcription
2123.901	2127.56	<font color='navy'>from each other, and they will continue to separate us.</font>	Transcription

2584.281	2594.81	<font color='#008080'>hurricane hit the gulf, I decided that Furious Flower had to do something relevant. And so this whole idea of <i>Mourning Katrina</i> was hatched.</font>	Transcription
2595.981	2608.94	<font color='#008080'>And, and the project was basically, I wanted people to respond to the tragedy of Katrina, by writing poetry about it.</font>	Transcription
2611.881	2627.99	<font color='#008080'>And so we sent out booklets, little pads, the computers, were not going to work. So we sent out to poets all over the country, and especially in the gulf, pads, and paper, and said, have your</font>	Transcription

2635.461	2655.65	<font color='#008080'>And do you know, over the next three or four months, we got back at least 200 poems, or, or pieces of verse, from children as young as four to people as old as 80. And I must tell you, that the</font>	Transcription

2658.381	2673.68	<font color='#008080'>that the first part of the project was just to have them write. And then I wanted, if I got the poem, to send out to my friends in the country, a few of these poems, and I wanted them to respond to</font>	Transcription
2673.681	2678.15	<font color='#008080'>the people who wrote the poems. So they would know that they were not alone.</font>	Transcription
2679.171	2695.16	<font color='#008080'>And Opal was a part of that. She was one of the people responding to these children or to these adults. The work was so dramatic and so worthwhile, That the first project we did as a result of the</font>	Transcription

2700.861	2724.74	<font color='#008080'>We got people in this community to read, on microphone, 25 of the poems that were selected from the 200-and-some that I got. And it was interesting. That&#39;s the way I first met Becky Thompson.</font>	Transcription

2750.001	2766.44	<font color='#008080'>So I just got local people who wanted to give voice to the poem, and opportunity to read. And then I combined it with gospel music. So that&#39;s what this tape is all about. Could you find yours? And</font>	Transcription
