17.415169	50.992616	<font color="#008080">Houston, I think of this as being a continuation of a conversation we had some years ago about a Black critical enterprise, and I think of it as a kind of update. This time, rather than being very general, we're focusing much more on poetry. On poetics, your poetry, and the whole process of poetic creation. And to get us started, I'm going to ask if you'd be so kind as to read, <i>This is not a Poem</i>. It's on page 491.</font>	Transcription, Question
51.619061	56.943843	<font color="navy">491. I will read this.</font>	Transcription
57.194421	72.041165	<font color="navy">"This is not a poem. This is not a poem, nor aesthetic experience. This is the story of my grandmother's hands chapped from white folks' wash, an account of her back spasmed from scrubbing floors.</font>	Transcription
72.041165	85.572375	<font color="navy">This is not a poem, nor icy art emotion. This is a narrative of my father's father, scraping pennies from a rocky economy, depression devouring everything in sight.</font>	Transcription
85.572375	107.435303	<font color="navy">This is not a poem, nor subtle tingle down your spine while shaving. This is a tale of my mother rebuked for calling a Black man, gentlemen, 'Lizzie, tell your daughter, niggers are not gentlemen.'</font>	Transcription
107.435303	134.748301	<font color="navy">This is no poem. Nor am I blessed to be impersonal. I will make no attempt to distance you. Had you been there while I was growing up, Or even in the thin worn time of their decline, I would have introduced you. Allowed you to share the fine goodness of ancestral caring."</font>	Transcription
135.186813	155.608917	<font color="#008080">Thank you. It reminds me, in some ways, of another poem entitled "Beware do not Read this Poem". And what I want to ask is: how does a poem which seems to cancel out its poem-ness, or we might say one's set of aesthetic expectations, come about?</font>	Transcription, Question
155.608917	180.792002	<font color="navy">I think, along the lines. And this always happens with us, we just move into sync. It's the hunger of that poem, which it seems to me is the hunger of memory, the hunger of desire, the hunger for a certain kind of community.</font>	Transcription
180.792002	209.733757	<font color="navy">And I think that poetry at its best translates that hunger in ways that can seem self-cancelling. To assert the negation is, in some ways, a defense against starvation. You hope that people are going to come to you and say, on the contrary, that's a really fine poem. Let me meet these people you're talking about.</font>	Transcription
209.733757	224.204635	<font color="navy">So it's in part bodily-driven by those hungers of memory, and in part, the kind of poetic negation and ruse that does bring one into community.</font>	Transcription
224.204635	254.96308	<font color="navy">And when I was first moving in ways that I thought were poetical-- there is always a backstory-- my wife of many years, when I would give her Ginsburgian beat-like lengthy pages, would often come back to me and say, "This is not a poem". So it works on a number of levels.</font>	Transcription
254.96308	267.241401	<font color="#008080">Right. So the real poem had to come out of, in this instance, of some very important life experiences, learning experiences, which were exceptionally autobiographical.</font>	Transcription
267.241401	268.306357	<font color="navy">Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
268.306357	301.883804	<font color="#008080">And I think that is one of the reasons I'm interested in the poem, because I'm getting this resonance, right? And speaking of this resonance-- and resonance thinking of space and our choices too-- how would you suggest to me that your life experiences, your autobiographical experiences, your hunger of memory, has indeed affected... two practices: your poetic practice, and your critical practice?</font>	Transcription, Question
303.136694	331.201426	<font color="navy">I think one of the most important things about my discovery and turn to the autobiographical or the memoiristic was that it created entirely new and solacing, soothing, comfortable space for movement.</font>	Transcription
331.201426	351.05973	<font color="navy">I came through graduate school at a time when one was supposed to approach formal greatness of white, mainly male, poets without emotion, and to allow them to say whatever they pleased.</font>	Transcription
351.05973	375.177859	<font color="navy">So if there was a "nigger" in the poem, and you sitting in the class as the only Black graduate student responded to that in emotional ways, you were told that this was the "affective fallacy". That you had allowed your emotions to creep in, that you were taking it personally, and that poetry was not personable. Poetry, T.S. Eliot tells us, is an escape from emotion.</font>	Transcription
375.177859	405.998949	<font color="navy">So I pretty much got schooled, and learned a technique which was very useful, of close reading in those graduate days of training. And when I moved into Afro-American literary theory and criticism I was, number one, quite emotional. It was an amazing period of discovery, I was reading literally 20 documents of one kind or another a day, I was using the Beinecke library at Yale.</font>	Transcription
405.998949	437.759706	<font color="navy">And I was coming to that kind of recognition of myself in the work. And it took a while longer to realize that as a critical practice the integration of this personal emotion, this affect, this memory of one's own life, was absolutely essential to any critical or theoretical essay that was going to be seasoned, as it were.</font>	Transcription
437.759706	468.455507	<font color="navy">That was going to reflect home training, that was going to be useful for a community-- constructed, imagined-- of people who would say, "aha, that gives to the work that you do a certain flavor that, had you decided to remain impersonal, emotionless, formalistic in your criticism, we wouldn't have found, and we feel empowered by."</font>	Transcription
468.455507	484.931008	<font color="navy">It draw-- I think it draws people to you when you do it in a way that is connected. I mean, it helps to make the critical point.</font>	Transcription
484.931008	504.977246	<font color="navy">I don't think just telling things about my life in general is in any way interesting. There are many more interesting lives. But I think when you try to integrate the memoiristic as part of your critical practice, and work hard at it, it does draw people to you and empowers them, provides a kind of community voice, I think.</font>	Transcription
504.977246	509.299716	<font color="#008080">Alright. But does that hold equally true for your poetry?</font>	Transcription, Question
509.299716	535.046602	<font color="navy">Actually, despite my wife's warnings, in my early poetry I thought I would still not mind being a beat poet. So my first volume of poetry is a kind of a combination. Some unkind people might even speak of it as a hodgepodge. But no matter where you travel, you still be Black. It's still one of my favorite poems of all those that I've written.</font>	Transcription
535.046602	554.716972	<font color="navy">And I think the fact that I had looked to Leroi Jones, Amiri Baraka, as a model of the best of the beats helped me to find something of the blues in some of the shorter lyrics in that first volume of poetry.</font>	Transcription
554.341105	560.229687	<font color="#008080">Well, in fact you wrote very well about the Baraka in the premier issue of <i>Minority Voices</i>.</font>	Transcription
559.229687	562.484889	<font color="navy">Thank you, thank you.</font>	Transcription
560.229687	577.7075	<font color="#008080">The piece that you did [Inaudible] printed. And I'm interested in a kind of boomerang because when you say that, no matter where you travel you still be Black, that is echoed in some of your most recent criticism.</font>	Transcription
577.7075	605.083143	<font color="navy">It certainly is. I mean, when I think now about the vagaries of life and the reasons that one chooses a particular venue for one's work, I'm a bit astonished that my wife and I are living in a small 100,000 population community in the South,</font>	Transcription
605.083143	631.707052	<font color="navy">where it is delightfully and celebratorily impossible to go out the front door and travel to any place without seeing a lot of Black people. And Black people of various classes and castes and occupations. It is impossible to travel in that community without seeing Central American and Mexican American people.</font>	Transcription
631.707052	644.92504	<font color="navy">And if you forget your discount card in Kroger's, right, unlike in the chilly north, there are 18 people handing you their cards to swipe-- we know you need the money. We all need the money.</font>	Transcription
644.92504	660.210296	<font color="navy">Six years ago, had you told me I would have turned south again and gone geographically back to a place where I travel comfortably among people of color in my everyday life, I would have said, Oh Jerry, stop. No it's not going to happen.</font>	Transcription
660.210296	695.917656	<font color="navy">So I think there is that impulse, that impulsion to be in a place where the work that you're doing is not only regionally supported-- for indeed, the South has been a kind of great mother, and father to me and my work and criticism. But also you're motivated by the demographics of the environment. So yeah, no matter where you travel, it seems that you go and kind of circle and come back upon yourself in uncanny ways.</font>	Transcription
695.917656	708.634487	<font color="#008080">Excellent. Now I have to ask the question that people all want to know answers to, following Ralph Ellison: Who are your literary ancestors?</font>	Transcription, Question
708.634487	709.260932	<font color="navy">Ahh.</font>	Transcription
709.260932	710.325889	<font color="#008080">It's a Southern question.</font>	Transcription
710.325889	736.323353	<font color="navy">It is a Southern question. Well, you know, I thought at one point, in the talk that I was graciously invited to give today that I would preface it with two anecdotes and-- done very quickly. One was when I took pen in hand, and decided to take on precisely Mr. Ellison and the True Blood episode in <i>Invisible Man</i>.</font>	Transcription
736.323353	766.517998	<font color="navy">I wrote the essay when I was working on-- working to become a theorist, a literary theorist. So it's interdisciplinary, but the impulse to the essay was the blues. So I wrote the essay, I sent it off to the premier, arguably the premier journal. The certification, the academy of literary criticism, PMLA <i>Publications of the Modern Language Association</i>.</font>	Transcription
766.517998	795.647686	<font color="navy">I got back a first note from Judy Goulding, who remains a friend to this day and remains at Modern Language Association to this day, and she said, Congratulations! --And I thought, "Man, I did this. I'm ready", You know?-- You're among 15% of the essays that will go now to the readers. And I was like, there's another step? There was. There was the 5%, and then there was finally the acceptance of the essay.</font>	Transcription
795.647686	816.570946	<font color="navy">Well, the acceptance of the essay came back saying, the readers love the work you did. They only have one suggestion, which you're free to follow or not: Could you take out the whole section on the blues? And I thought, "Wait, wait, guys. I'm trying to introduce the blues to the academy, to PMLA."</font>	Transcription
816.570946	849.459304	<font color="navy">Okay? The second anecdote works in exactly the opposite way. I was with a group of really eminent academics who had drunk far too much of whatever it was they were drinking, and so they were a bit tipsy. They were all white. And I don't know what the perverse impulse was on my part, to say-- we must have gotten to discuss the vernacular art or other literatures-- and I said, Well, you know, T.S. Eliot had a profound influence on a person like Kamau Brathwaite, and it's Eliot's vernacular rhythms and the integration of song.</font>	Transcription
849.459304	876.897592	<font color="navy">And one of the tipsy fellows looked at me, he said, "That's a ridiculous notion. Thomas Stearns Eliot, among the darkies? The funniest thing I've ever heard." So when one is looking at ancestors, right, you say, well, you take the blues to the academy and they say, take it out. Then you take T.S. Eliot right in his motion toward vernacular poetry as their celebrated icon, and they reject that too.</font>	Transcription
876.897592	904.398523	<font color="navy">So one is always, I think, being challenged to say, Well T.S. Eliot is as important to me as the blues. I can quote you chapter and verse of Eliot's criticism, and we were required in my first major poetry class at Howard University to memorize the first 30 lines of <i>The Wasteland</i>.</font>	Transcription
904.398523	933.904079	<font color="navy">So that brand of modernism is very important to me. I've already mentioned the beats. I've mentioned the connection of the blues form, rolling as blues and jazz through that whole bohemian movement. Wright is perhaps the person that as artist, writer, striver in the world, I would most like to be like when I grow up.</font>	Transcription
933.904079	958.460719	<font color="navy">And I love, I just combatively love, fighting pitch battles with those who see the the downside of Wright. And it's there, of course. I mean, he's autodidact, he's self-taught, but he's brutally and fiercely honest about life. And he's incredibly reaching in his criticism and so forth.</font>	Transcription
958.460719	966.98037	<font color="#008080">And incredibly relevant to us and to enabling us to open up some of the problems of 21st century.</font>	Transcription
966.98037	967.857393	<font color="navy">Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
967.857393	980.699514	<font color="#008080">And I think one of the problems of the 21st century, and it has been talked about quite a bit at Furious Flower, has to do with the technology and sound and the future of poetry and other forms.</font>	Transcription
980.699514	1011.33267	<font color="#008080">And I would like to go back to something that you wrote 11 years ago, Houston, in rap-- <i>Black Studies, Rap, and the Academy</i>, where you mention that, and I'm going to quote this, your graduate students, quote, "believe the function of poetry belongs in our era, to a telecommunal populace space, in which a global audience interacts with performative artists.</font>	Transcription
1011.33267	1030.689818	<font color="#008080">A link between music and performances, specifically popular music and performance seems determining in their definition of the current and future production of poetry." And I have two questions related to that particular passage.</font>	Transcription
1030.689818	1053.930924	<font color="#008080">Is this still, your thinking of what the case is with poetry? And secondly, if it is, what is happening to the Lowground and Inaudible Valleys? The categories of spirit, soul, character, and what some of us once believed poetry could give us: hope?</font>	Transcription, Question
1054.244147	1087.195149	<font color="navy">I, you know, I think that the burst of rap-- hip hop culture, as the larger picture-- on the United States scene, so well chronicled by Tricia Rose and Michael Eric Dyson, and Robin Kelly and a number of other people, stunned people who had only engaged in the formal study of poetry.</font>	Transcription
1087.195149	1120.459374	<font color="navy">Remember, these graduate students mentioned are mostly between the ages of 22 and 26, or 27. And as much of a progressive as I like to think of myself being, I suspect that some of their training in poetry was not substantially different from what I got in graduate school. Where they were told about the formal craft-- it has to be written, there have to be prizes and awards in certification, the Academy of American Poets has to have signed off on you.</font>	Transcription
1120.459374	1157.92078	<font color="navy">And so when they witnessed something that you and I know, the performativity of a vernacular at work on MTV, and BET, and on stages, and at poetry slams and venues that were street corners, all over the United States of America. I mean, there was a slam-master in Kansas, there was a slam-master in Toledo. And so spoken art had come to their attention, in part, through television and a telecommunal economy.</font>	Transcription
1157.92078	1188.616581	<font color="navy">It spread in the same way. That is to say, you and I have both been to the continent, to Africa, and seen CNN playing in the places that we were staying and realizing God, my older brother is watching this in Albany, even as I'm watching it here now. So the global spread of the form, the popularization of the form was there, and it brought back. I mean, Manthia Diwara has written about this: when he got to Africa, camera picks up moves from traditional African dance and brings it back, and dress, and so forth.</font>	Transcription
1188.616581	1208.788107	<font color="navy">So I think students were overwhelmed by this. They had never seen anything like it. At present, it seems to me-- and Tony Medina would be one of the people who I think would sign off on this-- it's become a battle, contestatory that is spoken arts.</font>	Transcription
1208.788107	1237.855151	<font color="navy">And many people believe that having some command of the language and the license to go out of an evening to wherever the venue is, makes them poets. And Tony says that the combative nature of this is not what Lowground and Inaudible Valleys and a communal spirit and a folk vernacular coming into play.</font>	Transcription
1237.855151	1267.924507	<font color="navy">Part of it has to do with the money. We talked about that today, of course. So, I mean, in an earlier session of Furious Flower we talked about the economics of rap. When places begin both buying and selling the independent labels, it becomes homogenized. The worst aspects of the form or of the content are put forward as all-day viewing.</font>	Transcription
1267.924507	1307.139959	<font color="navy">And by this I have particularly in mind the derogation of Black women and the misogyny of the form. Dealing with its social constructedness-- people who have a Master's degree from Bard and their undergraduate degree from Yale, dressed in pants falling off of them, talking about how they are about to take care of gangsta business. So I mean, I think currently the falling off in what is offered, both nationally and globally, would produce a different answer in my classroom, if I were to ask students about poetry.</font>	Transcription
1307.139959	1341.719718	<font color="#008080">Because the answer that you've given us, certainly causes me a little bit of anxiety. When I'm reminded that Furious Flower two is a celebration of a tradition, and I'm wondering if this tradition, and this emerging tradition which is truly international, will completely eclipse the tradition that we usually have in mind when we refer to African American poetry in such a way that it will thoroughly eradicate and replace that tradition.</font>	Transcription
1341.719718	1356.503818	<font color="#008080">I think it will be a tremendous loss. And I don't know exactly, Houston maybe you can have some suggestions, on how to initiate that particular conversation between the generations or among the generations of poets. </font>	Transcription, Question
1356.503818	1386.823752	<font color="navy">It's very, very difficult to do. I mean, I-- the recent study, NEA, I think it was-- on reading, and who's reading, that revealed that the reading habits of particularly the young have gone, just, away. They don't exist. I mean, it's something like a 30% drop in people who've read anything.</font>	Transcription
1386.823752	1410.252792	<font color="navy">I mean, it's not simply reading poetry, but they haven't read novels, they haven't read plays, they don't read the newspaper. So given that sort of depression economy of reading, among the young, it's difficult to think of a traditional presentation of our tradition to those students.</font>	Transcription
1410.252792	1440.63537	<font color="navy">It seems to me that one of the incumbencies-- and you know this well, because you do it magnificently-- for those of us who occupy privileged spaces of speaking, that gives us access to people who want to be there for the most part, is a creative, innovative, improvisational pedagogy. I think this is completely necessary these days.</font>	Transcription
1440.63537	1473.27315	<font color="navy">When I gave up the notion of impersonality, and form alone as the drive of criticism, I gave up the same in terms of teaching, traveling places to address audiences. And it seems to me that if we can demonstrate the best of our tradition in our privileged, articulate moments, with people who want to be in the room, then we can stir interest.</font>	Transcription
1473.27315	1496.013101	<font color="navy">And once one has stirred interest, you can send people out-- indeed, with my best students, I've been able to do that-- with whole libraries, and they get completely energized and excited and they want to talk endlessly to you about these things. So I'm not discouraged at this point.</font>	Transcription
1496.013101	1524.4537	<font color="navy">I think it is much harder now given the social environs, globally, and the depression in reading that's upon us. Harder than it was in, say the '70s, when everywhere, barber shops, beauty parlors, churches, there were reading clubs. People were carrying copies of Fanon, people were carrying copies of Gwendolyn Brooks.</font>	Transcription
1524.4537	1545.627538	<font color="navy">And bookstores were there-- independent ones, which are virtually impossible to keep going these days. In those independent bookstores, people were having readings, they were coming from out of town to Mr. Michaux up on 125th street. So we've lost a lot of that immediacy that made the job easier.</font>	Transcription
1545.627538	1577.388295	<font color="navy">On the other hand, I'm a partisan of Blackboard as an internet tool in my teaching. I think a really first-rate website can stand one in awfully good stead. And those people who are not reading books bought in Barnes and Noble and Borders are reading what my assistant puts on of Gwendolyn Brooks and Robert Hayden and-- because it's the assignment.</font>	Transcription
1577.388295	1580.959031	<font color="#008080">Yes, and the Blackboard is righted by use. It's a wonderful tool--</font>	Transcription
1580.959031	1581.836054	<font color="navy">It's a wonderful tool.</font>	Transcription
1581.836054	1586.847613	<font color="#008080">except that you have to know it's not the answer. You have to do a lot of work to be able to [inaudible].</font>	Transcription
1585.156212	1587.474058	<font color="navy">You do! You do.</font>	Transcription
1587.474058	1599.877668	<font color="#008080">I have two final questions, Houston. When we-- and your wording reminded me so much of this conversation from previous years, about what we were very-- said, Oh all these people are reading, all these people are reading poetry!</font>	Transcription
1599.877668	1600.817335	<font color="navy">Right, right.</font>	Transcription
1600.817335	1602.00758	<font color="#008080">And we can't say that anymore.</font>	Transcription
1601.819647	1602.69667	<font color="navy">No we can't.</font>	Transcription
1602.69667	1625.060753	<font color="#008080">But we also had in our youth then a kind of arrogance of believing that without prescription that we would create, African American poets had various roles to play. And are we now in a moment when we can't even speak of an African American poet's role?</font>	Transcription, Question
1625.060753	1650.932928	<font color="navy">Um... I don't think we're there. It seems to me as I look at folk who, like me, are getting grayer and grayer of hair, they have not turned away from their self-designated role as poet for the people.</font>	Transcription
1650.932928	1674.487257	<font color="navy">I think, of course, of Sonia Sanchez in this way. The late Gwendolyn Brooks never abdicated that role. I have to believe that some of the younger poets who are going out to, despite the combativeness of them, some of these spoken art venues.</font>	Transcription
1674.487257	1704.869835	<font color="navy">I saw a wonderful piece on spoken art written by a person who is at Columbia Teachers College, a young woman who, I think she may be teaching there now. But I mean, what exists as a community of people in these sites, and people who do come to perform, who bring their work to the table, I think are committed in the ways of a Baraka or a Sonia Sanchez, or a Haki Madubhuti to a specific audience--</font>	Transcription
1704.869835	1741.579507	<font color="navy">doesn't exclude anybody but it's principally African American. I think people are trying to tailor their observational practice to important realities of the world in which we live. So I think we're, the poets, we're always going to have with our community and playing a role of shaman, conjurer, medicine man, medicine woman, and helping us in our daily lives.</font>	Transcription
1743.020331	1766.950526	<font color="#008080">Gwendolyn Brooks said, "we are each other's/ harvest:/ We are each other's/ business:/ We are [each other,] each other's/ magnitude and bond." And at the Furious Flower conference ten years ago, there was a sense of being bonded into a collective. In what ways do you find this true now, and how has that changed? </font>	Transcription, Question
1766.950526	1784.804206	<font color="#008080">Because some friends and I have talked about collective: the feeling of being in a collective and how that really has to be measured against the hard, real politics of illusionary communities.</font>	Transcription
1784.804206	1806.792423	<font color="navy">Yeah, I have written recently that the one thing that was said by an emergent middle class, circa 1971 or '72, the one thing that was said to the Black majority was goodbye.</font>	Transcription
1806.792423	1830.785263	<font color="navy">I think that the class formation that is the Black middle class in the United States now--  comprising actually small numbers, but people try to make them large, to say that everything is alright and Dr. King really did fix the American racial problem.</font>	Transcription
1830.785263	1859.727018	<font color="navy">But we're talking 25 to 26% of the African American population, who probably are best positioned financially and politically, socially, to make a difference, for the most part are not interested in making the kind of difference that I think you imply when you talk about the building of community. Each one teach one, you gotta reach back in order to go forward.</font>	Transcription
1859.727018	1877.267476	<font color="navy">The only way that we can consider ourselves in any way well-off or safe is by realizing that no matter where you travel, you still be Black. That we must be concerned about the Black majority. I think that's been lost.</font>	Transcription
1877.267476	1906.960965	<font color="navy">On the other hand, that ascension has put a person, you name it-- Arnold Rampersad at Stanford, Maryemma Graham, Kansas-- we could just go across the ports of access that have been established for us as a result of affirmative action. That doesn't mean you didn't work hard or that I didn't merit being in the places that I am.</font>	Transcription
1906.960965	1922.810021	<font color="navy">So I think it's a complicated time. I do think the new venues that are available in waves and numbers-- we were 2% I think when we talked, we're 5% now. It's not monumental, but it's a gain.</font>	Transcription
1922.810021	1958.07887	<font color="navy">And I think if we we continue, in the faith as it were, to look toward the strategic positive advancements that we've made, the technology that will help us to forward those conferences like Furious Flower that, as I said to somebody this morning, were unimaginable when we had that first conversation with professor Joanne Gabbin receiving the university's fifth service award ever given.</font>	Transcription
1958.07887	1985.203935	<font color="navy">So I think there's a lot of reason to hope, Jerry. And I think those people who are working now, in the trenches, young and old, are full of energy. I don't think there is any chance of winning back a large proportion of that Black middle class I've just talked about. And that's too bad.</font>	Transcription
1985.203935	2011.953132	<font color="navy">On the other hand, one of the interesting things is I'm sure all of us who are in these, again, articulate positions of speaking in traditionally all-white institutions have a lot of white students who are often quite well financed, and are ready to go into the trenches themselves.</font>	Transcription
2011.953132	2030.495902	<font color="navy">I mean, it's not something one could have anticipated. But it's there. And I think that there will be new constituencies of folk, joining African Americans in the journey toward the future of African American poetry.</font>	Transcription
2034.066638	2044.84149	<font color="#008080">Well make me feel for the moment that perhaps that middle class will somehow discover W.E.B. Dubois.</font>	Transcription
2044.84149	2046.282314	<font color="navy">That would be nice.</font>	Transcription
2046.282314	2062.006081	<font color="#008080">And somehow suggest to itself that maybe, since we have such great privileges, we should reach out and bring forward some people. I'm not gonna say who. They may not be African Americans, they may be other people.</font>	Transcription
2062.006081	2093.51626	<font color="#008080">It's the tradition of caring that I spoke about earlier today-- doing something out of a sense of love and even poetry coming out of that sense that if you read Toni Morrison's most recent novel, <i>Love</i>, you will understand why I'm so concerned about it because her analysis of what love is and is not is exceptionally provocative. That's a good word, isn't it?</font>	Transcription
2091.69957	2094.455928	<font color="navy">That's a nice word.</font>	Transcription
2094.455928	2105.105491	<font color="#008080">It's very, very provocative, and I think she's on target about that. So if you don't have that condition, that tradition of the village, right?</font>	Transcription
2104.291113	2105.857225	<font color="navy">Yes, yes.</font>	Transcription
2105.857225	2130.351221	<font color="#008080">Which we like to talk about all of the time. If you don't have that somehow in your national conduct of everyday life, then perhaps the poetry that you do produce will lend itself to, or will be very vulnerable to those forces that we also talked about this morning: the forces of capitalism which can be deadly for art.</font>	Transcription, Question
2130.351221	2163.678091	<font color="navy">I think that's right. I mean, I think that in some ways, everything has changed as I walk about on the earth. And then in other ways, I guess I'm enough of both a traditionalist and an idealist-- a traditional idealist as it were-- to believe that one makes converts one at a time, and that it's easy, in revolutionary times, to mistake enthusiasts for converts.</font>	Transcription
2164.429825	2189.487621	<font color="navy">And so I think that the praxis of our criticism, and of our teaching, and the necessity of our integrity, and the perseverance of our spirits, is going to allow us to engage in that practice of making sincere, devoted, dedicated, working converts.</font>	Transcription
2189.487621	2233.025543	<font color="navy">We're going to be successful in it. It may not look as flourishing as it did at one time. But I do have a faith that it's going on, that people like you and many, many others have shoulder to the wheel. And what so impresses me now, I must say, in this younger generation, is that those who do have the gift, and who do have the will-- along with enthusiasm, to be sure-- are harder workers and more generous of spirit than any group of people I have ever seen.</font>	Transcription
2233.025543	2267.85588	<font color="navy">There's a counter (of course) population, youthful, to what I've just described. But those who are there, and in the spirit and doing the work, are an amazing, beautiful, talented, generous group of people. And part of what we do is to facilitate ways for it to be easy for them to lend their energy actively to the cause.</font>	Transcription
2267.85588	2280.259489	<font color="#008080">Many of those young people are at this conference. And I think, Houston, they certainly stand in relation to you and to me, in the same way that we stood in relation to ghostwriters in the College Language Association.</font>	Transcription
2280.259489	2281.261801	<font color="navy">Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
2281.261801	2305.317286	<font color="#008080">You know, it was a little bit combative, but we did have respect for them and for their contributions. And even though we had very different minds about where to go, we did not lose sight of their contributions, as you very nicely reminded us in your work on critical shifts.</font>	Transcription
2305.317286	2329.435415	<font color="#008080">The paradigms will change, but you still have, whether you say it aloud or not, a sense of respect for struggles in the past, that even if they're not of immediate use to you, are there and have to be somehow incorporated in the work.</font>	Transcription
2329.685993	2341.463157	<font color="navy">I think with that note, we should probably leave that bridge of possibility and we'll begin a conversation much sooner, it won't be that many years.</font>	Transcription
2341.463157	2341.77638	<font color="#008080">Okay.</font>	Transcription
2341.77638	2344.783316	<font color="navy">Once again. Thank you, Jerry. It was wonderful.</font>	Transcription
2342.590758	2343.718359	<font color="#008080">Thank you so much.</font>	Transcription
2345.910916	2355.057012	Really nice. Thank you. Don't move yet. If you want to just talk. One at a time [Inaudible].	Transcription
2348.040829	2350.859831	Stay sitting for just a minute.	Transcription
2350.233386	2353.553544	<font color="navy">Okay. Okay, okay.</font>	Transcription
2353.193338	2354.853418	<font color="#008080">Well that was a wonderful conversation.</font>	Transcription
2354.242634	2365.299386	<font color="navy">Thanks. That's one of my favorite poems. And the people who make it up include the doctor.</font>	Transcription
2365.299386	2386.974381	<font color="navy">Dr. Jackson. My maternal grandmother was called a receptionist for the doctor, but she showed up at his house at 5:30 each morning and made all the fires in the house. Cooked breakfast for Dr. and Mrs. Jackson, cleaned the house, was given 40 minute-- </font>	Transcription
