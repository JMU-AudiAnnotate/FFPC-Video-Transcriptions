17.551	30.96	<font color='#008080'>Houston, I think of this as being a continuation of a conversation we had some years ago about a Black critical enterprise, and I think of it as a kind of update. This time, rather than</font>	Transcription
30.961	45.87	<font color='#008080'>being very general, we&#39;re focusing much more on poetry. On poetics, your poetry, and the whole process of poetic creation. And to get us started, I&#39;m going to ask if you&#39;d be so kind as to read,</font>	Transcription
46.531	50.76	<font color='#008080'><i>This is not a Poem</i>. It&#39;s on page 491.</font>	Transcription
51.83	54.92	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
51.831	54.92	<font color='navy'>491. I will read this.</font>	Transcription
57.531	71.99	<font color='navy'>&quot;This is not a poem. This is not a poem, nor aesthetic experience. This is the story of my grandmother&#39;s hands chapped from white folks&#39; wash, an account of her back spasmed from scrubbing floors.</font>	Transcription
72.471	85.43	<font color='navy'>This is not a poem, nor icy art emotion. This is a narrative of my father&#39;s father, scraping pennies from a rocky economy, depression devouring everything in sight.</font>	Transcription
85.731	106.28	<font color='navy'>This is not a poem, nor subtle tingle down your spine while shaving. This is a tale of my mother rebuked for calling a Black man, gentlemen, &quot;Lizzie, tell your daughter, niggers are not gentlemen.&quot;</font>	Transcription
107.871	126.41	<font color='navy'>This is no poem. Nor am I blessed to be impersonal. I will make no attempt to distance you. Had you been there while I was growing up, Or even in the thin worn time of their decline, I would have</font>	Transcription
126.411	134.18	<font color='navy'>introduced you. Allowed you to share the fine goodness of ancestral caring.&quot;</font>	Transcription
135.47	150.2	<font color='#008080'><b>Jerry Ward</b></font>	Speaker
135.471	150.2	<font color='#008080'>Thank you. It reminds me, in some ways, of another poem entitled &quot;\<i>Beware: Do not Read this Poem</i> What I want to ask is: how does a poem which seems to cancel out its poem-ness, or</font>	Transcription
150.231	154.79	<font color='#008080'>we might say one&#39;s set of aesthetic expectations, come about?</font>	Transcription
155.72	176.75	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
155.721	176.75	<font color='navy'>I think, along the lines. And this always happens with us, we just move into sync. It&#39;s the hunger of that poem, which it seems to me is the hunger of memory, the hunger of desire, the</font>	Transcription
176.751	180.65	<font color='navy'>hunger for a certain kind of community.</font>	Transcription
181.131	200.57	<font color='navy'>And I think that poetry at its best translates that hunger in ways that can seem self-cancelling. To assert the negation is, in some ways, a defense against starvation. You hope that people are going</font>	Transcription
200.571	209.63	<font color='navy'>to come to you and say, on the contrary, that&#39;s a really fine poem. Let me meet these people you&#39;re talking about.</font>	Transcription
209.781	223.37	<font color='navy'>So it&#39;s in part bodily-driven by those hungers of memory, and in part, the kind of poetic negation and ruse that does bring one into community.</font>	Transcription
224.361	247.85	<font color='navy'>And when I was first moving in ways that I thought were poetical-- there is always a backstory-- my wife of many years, when I would give her Ginsburgian beat-like lengthy pages, would often come back</font>	Transcription
247.851	254.72	<font color='navy'>to me and say, &quot;This is not a poem&quot;. So it works on a number of levels.</font>	Transcription
254.76	267.27	<font color='#008080'><b>Jerry Ward</b></font>	Speaker
254.761	267.27	<font color='#008080'>Right. So the real poem had to come out of, in this instance, of some very important life experiences, learning experiences, which were exceptionally autobiographical.</font>	Transcription
267.45	268.11	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
267.451	268.11	<font color='navy'>Absolutely.</font>	Transcription
268.11	280.5	<font color='#008080'><b>Jerry Ward</b></font>	Speaker
268.111	280.5	<font color='#008080'>And I think that is one of the reasons I&#39;m interested in the poem, because I&#39;m getting this resonance, right? And speaking of this resonance-- and resonance thinking of space and our</font>	Transcription
280.501	300.93	<font color='#008080'>choices too-- how would you suggest to me that your life experiences, your autobiographical experiences, your hunger of memory, has indeed affected... two practices: your poetic practice, and your</font>	Transcription
300.931	301.92	<font color='#008080'>critical practice?</font>	Transcription
303.19	329.71	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
303.191	329.71	<font color='navy'>I think one of the most important things about my discovery and turn to the autobiographical or the memoiristic was that it created entirely new and solacing, soothing, comfortable</font>	Transcription
329.711	331.0	<font color='navy'>space for movement.</font>	Transcription
331.721	350.89	<font color='navy'>I came through graduate school at a time when one was supposed to approach formal greatness of white, mainly male poets, without emotion, and to allow them to say whatever they pleased.</font>	Transcription
351.101	364.15	<font color='navy'>So if there was a nigger in the poem, and you sitting in the class, as the only Black graduate student responded to that in emotional ways, you were told that this was the &quot;affective fallacy&quot;. That</font>	Transcription
364.151	374.95	<font color='navy'>you had allowed your emotions to creep in, that you were taking it personally, and that poetry was not personable. Poetry, T.S. Eliot tells us, is an escape from emotion.</font>	Transcription
375.281	392.17	<font color='navy'>So I pretty much got schooled, and learned a technique which was very useful, of close reading in those graduate days of training. And when I moved into Afro-American literary theory and criticism I</font>	Transcription
392.171	405.82	<font color='navy'>was, number one, quite emotional. It was an amazing period of discovery, I was reading literally 20 documents of one kind or another a day, I was using the Beinecke library at Yale.</font>	Transcription
406.901	423.97	<font color='navy'>And I was coming to that kind of recognition of myself in the work. And it took a while longer to realize that as a critical practice the integration of this personal emotion, this affect, this memory</font>	Transcription
424.001	437.65	<font color='navy'>of one&#39;s own life, was absolutely essential to any critical or theoretical essay that was going to be seasoned, as it were.</font>	Transcription
437.651	458.95	<font color='navy'>That was going to reflect home training, that was going to be useful for a community-- constructed, imagined-- of people who would say, &quot;aha, that gives to the work that you do a certain flavor that,</font>	Transcription
458.951	468.28	<font color='navy'>had you decided to remain impersonal, emotionless, formalistic in your criticism, we wouldn&#39;t have found, and we feel empowered by.&quot;</font>	Transcription
469.211	484.87	<font color='navy'>I think it draws people to you when you do it in a way that is connected. I mean, it helps to make the critical point.</font>	Transcription
485.111	497.53	<font color='navy'>I don&#39;t think just telling things about my life in general is in any way interesting. There are many more interesting lives. But I think when you try to integrate the memoiristic as part of your</font>	Transcription
497.531	504.91	<font color='navy'>critical practice, and work hard at it, it does draw people to you and empowers them, provides a kind of community voice, I think.</font>	Transcription

505.171	509.01	<font color='#008080'>Alright. But does that hold equally true for your poetry?</font>	Transcription
509.75	526.7	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
509.751	526.7	<font color='navy'>Um, actually, despite my wife&#39;s warnings, in my early poetry I thought I would still not mind being a beat poet. So my first volume of poetry is a kind of a combination. Some unkind</font>	Transcription
526.701	535.01	<font color='navy'>people might even speak of it as a hodgepodge. But no matter where you travel, you still be Black. It&#39;s still one of my favorite poems of all those that I&#39;ve written.</font>	Transcription
535.401	553.79	<font color='navy'>And I think the fact that I had looked to Leroi Jones, Amiri Baraka, as a model of the best of the beats helped me to find something of the blues in some of the shorter lyrics in that first volume of</font>	Transcription

559.161	560.6	<font color='#008080'>Thank you, thank you.</font>	Transcription
560.641	576.54	<font color='#008080'>The piece that you did [Inaudible]. And I&#39;m interested in a kind of boomerang because when you say that, no matter where you travel you still be Black, that is echoed in some of your most recent</font>	Transcription

577.78	596.92	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
577.781	596.92	<font color='navy'>It certainly is. I mean, when I think now about the vagaries of life and the reasons that one chooses a particular venue for one&#39;s work, I&#39;m a bit astonished that my wife and I are</font>	Transcription
597.041	604.87	<font color='navy'>living in a small 100,000 population community in the South,</font>	Transcription
605.261	624.28	<font color='navy'>where it is delightfully and celebratorily impossible to go out the front door and travel to any place without seeing a lot of Black people. And Black people of various classes and castes and</font>	Transcription
624.281	631.69	<font color='navy'>occupations. It is impossible to travel in that community without seeing Central American and Mexican American people.</font>	Transcription
631.901	643.84	<font color='navy'>And if you forget your discount card in Kroger&#39;s, right, unlike in the chilly north, there are 18 people handing you their cards to swipe-- we know you need the money. We all need the money.</font>	Transcription
645.461	657.49	<font color='navy'>Six years ago, had you told me I would have turned south again and gone geographically back to a place where I travel comfortably among people of color in my everyday life, I would have said, Oh</font>	Transcription
657.491	660.13	<font color='navy'>Jerry, stop. No it&#39;s not going to happen.</font>	Transcription
661.271	676.27	<font color='navy'>So I think there is that impulse, that impulsion to be in a place where the work that you&#39;re doing is not only regionally supported-- for indeed, the South has been a kind of great mother, and father</font>	Transcription
676.271	693.82	<font color='navy'>to me and my work and criticism. But also you&#39;re motivated by the demographics of the environment. So yeah, no matter where you travel, it seems that you go and kind of circle and come back upon</font>	Transcription
693.821	695.74	<font color='navy'>yourself in uncanny ways.</font>	Transcription

696.691	708.51	<font color='#008080'>Excellent. Now I have to ask the question that people all want to know answers to, following Ralph Ellison. Who are your literary ancestors?</font>	Transcription

710.0	724.16	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
710.001	724.16	<font color='navy'>It is a Southern question. Well, you know, I thought at one point, in the talk that I was graciously invited to give today that I would preface it with two anecdotes and-- done very</font>	Transcription
724.161	735.95	<font color='navy'>quickly. One was when I took pen in hand, and decided to take on precisely Mr. Ellison and the True Blood episode in <i>Invisible Man</i>.</font>	Transcription
737.391	754.97	<font color='navy'>I wrote the essay when I was working on working to become a theorist, a literary theorist. So it&#39;s interdisciplinary, but the impulse to the essay was the blues. So I wrote the essay, I sent it off to</font>	Transcription
754.971	766.37	<font color='navy'>the premier, arguably the premier journal, the certification, the academy of literary criticism, PMLA <i>Publications of the Modern Language Association</i>.</font>	Transcription
766.001	778.96	<font color='navy'>I got back a first note from Judy Gotan, who remains a friend to this day and remains at Modern Language Association to this day, and she said, Congratulations! --And I thought, &quot;Man, I did this. I&#39;m</font>	Transcription
778.961	795.07	<font color='navy'>ready&quot;, You know?-- You&#39;re among 15% of the essays that will go now to the readers. And I was like, there&#39;s another step? There was. There was the 5%, and then there was finally the acceptance of the</font>	Transcription
795.071	795.52	<font color='navy'>essay.</font>	Transcription
795.731	808.84	<font color='navy'>Well, the acceptance of the essay came back saying, the readers love the work you did. They only have one suggestion, which you&#39;re free to follow or not: Could you take out the whole section on the</font>	Transcription
808.841	815.65	<font color='navy'>blues? And I thought, &quot;Wait, wait, guys. I&#39;m trying to introduce the blues to the academy, to PMLA.&quot;</font>	Transcription
815.771	826.51	<font color='navy'>Okay? The second anecdote works in exactly the opposite way. I was with a group of really eminent academics who had drunk far too much of whatever it was they were drinking, and so they were a bit</font>	Transcription
826.511	838.9	<font color='navy'>tipsy. They were all white. And I don&#39;t know what the perverse impulse was on my part, to say-- we must have gotten to discuss the vernacular art or other literatures-- and I said, Well, you know,</font>	Transcription
838.901	849.31	<font color='navy'>T.S. Eliot had a profound influence on a person like Kamau Brathwaite, and it&#39;s Eliot&#39;s vernacular rhythms and the integration of song.</font>	Transcription
849.671	863.86	<font color='navy'>And one of the tipsy fellows looked at me, he said, &quot;That&#39;s a ridiculous notion. Thomas Stearns Eliot, among the darkies? The funniest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.&quot; So when one is looking at ancestors,</font>	Transcription
863.861	876.46	<font color='navy'>right, you say, well, you take the blues to the academy and they say, take it out. Then you take T.S. Eliot right in his motion toward vernacular poetry as their celebrated icon, and they reject that</font>	Transcription
876.461	876.82	<font color='navy'>too.</font>	Transcription
877.601	896.86	<font color='navy'>So one is always, I think, being challenged to say well T.S. Eliot is as important to me as the blues. I can quote you chapter and verse of Eliot&#39;s criticism, and we were required in my first major</font>	Transcription
896.861	903.34	<font color='navy'>poetry class at Howard University to memorize the first 30 lines of <i>The Wasteland</i>.</font>	Transcription
904.451	921.64	<font color='navy'>So that brand of modernism is very important to me. I&#39;ve already mentioned the beats. I&#39;ve mentioned the connection of the blues form, rolling as blues and jazz through that whole bohemian movement.</font>	Transcription
922.421	933.85	<font color='navy'>Wright is perhaps the person that as artist, writer, striver in the world, I would most like to be like when I grow up.</font>	Transcription
935.111	951.13	<font color='navy'>And I love, I just combatively love, fighting pitch battles with those who see the the downside of Wright. And it&#39;s there, of course. I mean, he&#39;s autodidact, he&#39;s self-taught, but he&#39;s brutally and</font>	Transcription
951.131	958.48	<font color='navy'>fiercely honest about life. And he&#39;s incredibly reaching in his criticism and so forth.</font>	Transcription

981.011	997.24	<font color='#008080'>And I would like to go back to something that you wrote 11 years ago, Houston, in rap-- <i>Black Studies, Rap, and the Academy</i>, where you mention that, and I&#39;m going to quote this, your graduate</font>	Transcription
997.241	1011.34	<font color='#008080'>students, quote, &quot;believe the function of poetry belongs in our era, to a telecommunal populace space, in which a global audience interacts with performative artists.</font>	Transcription
1011.731	1027.72	<font color='#008080'>A link between music and performances, specifically popular music and performance seems determining in their definition of the current and future production of poetry.&quot; And I have two questions</font>	Transcription
1028.471	1030.6	<font color='#008080'>related to that particular passage.</font>	Transcription
1031.441	1050.31	<font color='#008080'>Is this still, you&#39;re thinking of what the case is with poetry? And secondly, if it is, what is happening to the Lowground and Inaudible Valleys? The categories of spirit, soul, character, and what</font>	Transcription
1050.311	1053.67	<font color='#008080'>some of us once believed poetry could give us: hope?</font>	Transcription
1054.75	1076.53	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
1054.751	1076.53	<font color='navy'>I, you know, I think that the burst of rap-- hip hop culture, as the larger picture-- on the United States scene, so well chronicled by Tricia Rose and Michael Eric Dyson, and Robin</font>	Transcription
1076.531	1087.27	<font color='navy'>Kelly and a number of other people, stunned people who had only engaged in the formal study of poetry.</font>	Transcription
1087.271	1102.78	<font color='navy'>Remember, these graduate students mentioned are mostly between the ages of 22 and 26, or 27. And as much of a progressive as I like to think of myself being, I suspect that some of their training in</font>	Transcription
1102.781	1116.76	<font color='navy'>poetry was not substantially different from what I got in graduate school. Where they were told about the formal craft-- it has to be written, there have to be prizes and awards in certification, the</font>	Transcription
1116.761	1120.27	<font color='navy'>Academy of American Poets has to have signed off on you.</font>	Transcription
1120.661	1141.54	<font color='navy'>And so when they witnessed something that you and I know, the performativity of a vernacular at work on MTV, and BET, and on stages, and at poetry slams and venues that were street corners, all over</font>	Transcription
1141.541	1155.61	<font color='navy'>the United States of America. I mean, there was a slam-master in Kansas, there was a slam-master in Toledo. And so spoken art had come to their attention, in part, through television and a</font>	Transcription
1155.671	1157.74	<font color='navy'>telecommunal economy.</font>	Transcription
1158.401	1171.18	<font color='navy'>It spread in the same way. That is to say, you and I have both been to the continent, to Africa, and seen CNN playing in the places that we were staying and realizing God, my older brother is watching</font>	Transcription
1171.181	1182.64	<font color='navy'>this in Albany, even as I&#39;m watching it here now. So the global spread of the form, the popularization of the form was there, and it brought back. I mean, Manthia Diwara has written about this: when</font>	Transcription
1182.641	1188.46	<font color='navy'>he got to Africa, camera picks up moves from traditional African dance and brings it back, and dress, and so forth.</font>	Transcription
1188.611	1202.59	<font color='navy'>So I think students were overwhelmed by this. They had never seen anything like it. At present, it seems to me-- and Tony Medina would be one of the people who I think would sign off on this-- it&#39;s</font>	Transcription
1202.591	1208.71	<font color='navy'>become a battle, contestatory that is spoken arts.</font>	Transcription
1208.741	1230.13	<font color='navy'>And many people believe that having some command of the language and the license to go out of an evening to wherever the venue is, makes them poets. And Tony says that the combative nature of this is</font>	Transcription
1230.131	1237.99	<font color='navy'>not what Lowground and Inaudible Valleys and a communal spirit and a folk vernacular coming into play.</font>	Transcription
1238.441	1253.47	<font color='navy'>Part of it has to do with the money. We talked about that today, of course. So, I mean, in an earlier session of Furious Flower we talked about the economics of rap. When places begin both buying and</font>	Transcription
1253.471	1267.9	<font color='navy'>selling the independent labels, it becomes homogenized. The worst aspects of the form or of the content are put forward as all-day viewing.</font>	Transcription
1267.991	1284.58	<font color='navy'>And by this I have particularly in mind the derogation of Black women and the misogyny of the form. Dealing with its social constructedness-- people who have a Master&#39;s degree from Bard and their</font>	Transcription
1284.611	1300.12	<font color='navy'>undergraduate degree from Yale, dressed in pants falling off of them, talking about how they are about to take care of gangsta business. So I mean, I think currently the falling off in what is</font>	Transcription
1300.121	1306.99	<font color='navy'>offered, both nationally and globally, would produce a different answer in my classroom, if I were to ask students about poetry.</font>	Transcription

1306.001	1320.76	<font color='#008080'>Because the answer that you&#39;ve given us, certainly causes me a little bit of anxiety. When I&#39;m reminded that Furious Flower two is a celebration of a tradition, and I&#39;m wondering if this</font>	Transcription

1335.581	1341.73	<font color='#008080'>will thoroughly eradicate and replace that tradition.</font>	Transcription
1341.871	1355.01	<font color='#008080'>I think it will be a tremendous loss. And I don&#39;t know exactly, Houston maybe you can have some suggestions, on how to initiate that particular conversation between the generations or among the</font>	Transcription

1357.05	1378.53	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
1357.051	1378.53	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s very, very difficult to do. I mean, I-- the recent study-- NEA, I think it was-- on reading, and who&#39;s reading, that revealed that the reading habits of particularly the young have</font>	Transcription
1378.531	1386.6	<font color='navy'>gone, just, away. They don&#39;t, they don&#39;t exist. I mean, it&#39;s something like a 30% drop in people who&#39;ve read anything.</font>	Transcription
1386.631	1401.24	<font color='navy'>I mean, it&#39;s not simply reading poetry, but they haven&#39;t read novels, they haven&#39;t read plays, they don&#39;t read the newspaper. So given that sort of depression economy of reading, among the young, it&#39;s</font>	Transcription
1401.241	1410.15	<font color='navy'>difficult to think of a traditional presentation of our tradition to those students.</font>	Transcription
1411.171	1428.36	<font color='navy'>It seems to me that one of the incumbencies-- and you know this well, because you do it magnificently-- for those of us who occupy privileged spaces of speaking, that gives us access to people who</font>	Transcription
1428.361	1440.45	<font color='navy'>want to be there for the most part, is a creative, innovative, improvisational pedagogy. I think this is completely necessary these days.</font>	Transcription
1441.531	1462.65	<font color='navy'>When I gave up the notion of impersonality, and form alone as the drive of criticism, I gave up the same in terms of teaching, traveling places to address audiences. And it seems to me that if we can</font>	Transcription
1462.651	1473.36	<font color='navy'>demonstrate the best of our tradition in our privileged, articulate moments, with people who want to be in the room, then we can stir interest.</font>	Transcription
1473.451	1489.56	<font color='navy'>And once one has stirred interest, you can send people out-- indeed, with my best students, I&#39;ve been able to do that-- with whole libraries, and they get completely energized and excited and they</font>	Transcription
1489.561	1496.16	<font color='navy'>want to talk endlessly to you about these things. So I&#39;m not discouraged at this point.</font>	Transcription
1496.641	1517.31	<font color='navy'>I think it is much harder now given the social environs, globally, and the depression in reading that&#39;s upon us. Harder than it was in, say the &#39;70s, when everywhere, barber shops, beauty parlors,</font>	Transcription
1517.341	1523.7	<font color='navy'>churches, there were reading clubs. People were carrying copies of Fanon, people were carrying copies of Gwendolyn Brooks.</font>	Transcription
1524.631	1537.59	<font color='navy'>And bookstores were there-- independent ones, which are virtually impossible to keep going these days. In those independent bookstores, people were having readings, they were coming from out of town</font>	Transcription
1537.591	1545.63	<font color='navy'>to Mr. Michaux up on 125th street. So we&#39;ve lost a lot of that immediacy that made the job easier.</font>	Transcription
1546.111	1565.19	<font color='navy'>On the other hand, I&#39;m a partisan of Blackboard as an internet tool in my teaching. I think a really first-rate website can stand one in awfully good stead. And those people who are not reading books</font>	Transcription

1602.361	1617.96	<font color='#008080'>But we also had in our youth then a kind of arrogance of believing that without prescription that we would create, African American poets had various roles to play. And are we now in a</font>	Transcription

1625.041	1649.97	<font color='navy'>Um, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re there. It seems to me as I look at folk who, like me, are getting grayer and grayer of hair, they have not turned away from their self-designated role as poet</font>	Transcription
1649.971	1650.75	<font color='navy'>for the people.</font>	Transcription
1651.081	1670.76	<font color='navy'>I think, of course, of Sonia Sanchez in this this way. The late Gwendolyn Brooks never abdicated that role. I have to believe that some of the younger poets who are going out to, despite the</font>	Transcription

1674.421	1687.83	<font color='navy'>I saw a wonderful piece on spoken art written by a person who is at Columbia Teachers College, a young woman who, I think she may be teaching there now. But I mean, what exists as a community of</font>	Transcription
1687.831	1704.18	<font color='navy'>people in these sites, and people who do come to perform, who bring their work to the table, I think are committed in the ways of a Baraka or a Sonia Sanchez, or a Haki Madhubuti to a specific</font>	Transcription
1704.181	1704.84	<font color='navy'>audience--</font>	Transcription
1705.861	1724.07	<font color='navy'>doesn&#39;t exclude anybody but it&#39;s principally African American. I think people are trying to tailor their observational practice to important realities of the world in which we live. So I think we&#39;re,</font>	Transcription
1724.101	1741.35	<font color='navy'>the poets, we&#39;re always going to have with our community and playing a role of shaman, conjurer, medicine man, medicine woman, and helping us in our daily lives.</font>	Transcription

1757.191	1766.49	<font color='#008080'>years ago, there was a sense of being bonded into a collective. In what ways do you find this true now, and how has that changed?</font>	Transcription
1767.301	1783.98	<font color='#008080'>Because some friends and I have talked about collective: the feeling of being in a collective and how that really has to be measured against the hard, real politics of illusionary communities.</font>	Transcription
1783.0	1806.43	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
1783.001	1806.43	<font color='navy'>Yeah, I have written recently that the one thing that was said by an emergent middle class, circa 1971 or &#39;72, the one thing that was said to the Black majority was goodbye.</font>	Transcription
1807.361	1827.67	<font color='navy'>I think that the class formation that is the Black middle class in the United States now--  comprising actually small numbers, but people try to make them large, to say that everything is alright and</font>	Transcription
1827.671	1830.64	<font color='navy'>Dr. King really did fix the American racial problem.</font>	Transcription
1830.911	1848.94	<font color='navy'>But we&#39;re talking 25 to 26% of the African American population, who probably are best positioned financially and politically, socially, to make a difference, for the most part are not interested in</font>	Transcription
1848.941	1859.62	<font color='navy'>making the kind of difference that I think you imply when you talk about the building of community. Each one teach one, you gotta reach back in order to go forward.</font>	Transcription
1860.491	1874.65	<font color='navy'>The only way that we can consider ourselves in any way well-off or safe is by realizing that <i>No Matter Where you Travel, you Still be Black</i>. That we must be concerned about the Black majority.</font>	Transcription
1875.041	1876.27	<font color='navy'>I think that&#39;s been lost.</font>	Transcription
1877.741	1899.49	<font color='navy'>On the other hand, that ascension has put a person, you name it-- Arnold Rampersad at Stanford, Maryemma Graham, Kansas-- we could just go across the ports of access that have been established for us</font>	Transcription
1899.521	1906.96	<font color='navy'>as a result of affirmative action. That doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t work hard or that I didn&#39;t merit being in the places that I am.</font>	Transcription
1907.291	1922.47	<font color='navy'>So I think it&#39;s a complicated time. I do think the new venues that are available in waves and numbers-- we were 2%, I think when we talked we&#39;re 5% now. It&#39;s not monumental, but it&#39;s a gain.</font>	Transcription
1923.521	1941.13	<font color='navy'>And I think if we we continue, in the faith as it were, to look toward the strategic positive advancements that we&#39;ve made, the technology that will help us to forward those conferences like Furious</font>	Transcription
1941.131	1957.96	<font color='navy'>Flower that, as I said to somebody this morning, were unimaginable when we had that first conversation with professor Joanne Gabbin receiving the university&#39;s fifth service award ever given.</font>	Transcription
1958.561	1977.28	<font color='navy'>So I think there&#39;s a lot of reason to hope, Jerry. And I think those people who are working now, in the trenches, young and old, are full of energy. I don&#39;t think there is any chance of winning back a</font>	Transcription
1977.341	1984.99	<font color='navy'>large proportion of that Black middle class I&#39;ve just talked about. And that&#39;s too bad.</font>	Transcription
1985.801	2002.6	<font color='navy'>On the other hand, one of the interesting things is I&#39;m sure all of us who are in these, again, articulate positions of speaking in traditionally all-white institutions have a lot of white students</font>	Transcription
2003.081	2012.05	<font color='navy'>who are often quite well financed, and are ready to go into the trenches themselves.</font>	Transcription
2012.081	2029.66	<font color='navy'>I mean, it&#39;s not something one could have anticipated. But it&#39;s there. And I think that there will be new constituencies of folk, joining African Americans in the journey toward the future of African</font>	Transcription

2062.931	2077.18	<font color='#008080'>It&#39;s the tradition of caring that I spoke about earlier today-- doing something out of a sense of love and even poetry coming out of that sense that if you read Toni Morrison&#39;s most recent novel,</font>	Transcription
2077.751	2092.93	<font color='#008080'><i>Love</i>, you will understand why I&#39;m so concerned about it because her analysis of what love is and is not is exceptionally provocative. That&#39;s a good word, isn&#39;t it?</font>	Transcription

2130.0	2146.62	<font color='navy'><b>Houston Baker</b></font>	Speaker
2130.001	2146.62	<font color='navy'>I think that&#39;s right. I mean, I think that in some ways, everything has changed as I walk about on the earth. And then in other ways, I guess I&#39;m enough of both a traditionalist and an</font>	Transcription
2146.621	2163.6	<font color='navy'>idealist-- a traditional idealist as it were-- to believe that one makes converts one at a time, and that it&#39;s easy, in revolutionary times, to mistake enthusiasts for converts.</font>	Transcription
2164.471	2184.0	<font color='navy'>And so I think that the praxis of our criticism, and of our teaching, and the necessity of our integrity, and the perseverance of our spirits, is going to allow us to engage in that practice of making</font>	Transcription

2190.421	2206.05	<font color='navy'>We&#39;re going to be successful in it. It may not look as flourishing as it did at one time. But I do have a faith that it&#39;s going on, that people like you and many, many others have shoulder to the</font>	Transcription
