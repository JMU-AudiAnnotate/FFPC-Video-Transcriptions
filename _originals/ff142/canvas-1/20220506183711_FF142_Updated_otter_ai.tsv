95.001	117.74	<font color='navy'>Well the poem came out of the idea of the drum. In Congo Square, the drum had been banned for a time of slavery. And what interested me about this idea of the drum being an object,</font>	Transcription
118.711	141.36	<font color='navy'>It could come alive, and and be instrumental in its necessary expression, passion as such. It&#39;s also a tribute to the idea of the daughter in the in the poem as well.</font>	Transcription

175.701	196.25	<font color='navy'>There are a number of my experiences in Australia, enliven my pursuit of certain images and certain ideas and poems. A good example of that would be <i>testimony</i>. Testimony came out of someone&#39;s</font>	Transcription

224.3	243.98	<font color='navy'><b>Yusef Komunyakaa</b></font>	Speaker
224.301	243.98	<font color='navy'>Well, it also takes us back to the idea that I have that, as far as language goes, it is our first music. It has a lot to do with how something is expressed. The body knows deeply</font>	Transcription
244.401	246.71	<font color='navy'>what the language is about.</font>	Transcription
247.231	266.22	<font color='navy'>And the body as an amplifier of emotions, images, and everything. I&#39;ve seen an image somewhere that says the body remembers, and in the same way in the drum. The drum remembers life.</font>	Transcription

267.501	281.99	<font color='#008080'>Well that&#39;s an interesting concept, because that suggests that, I mean what you&#39;re suggesting in terms of imagery coming from the body. And I&#39;ve read where you&#39;ve talked about poetry</font>	Transcription
281.991	285.41	<font color='#008080'>being integrally related to language itself.</font>	Transcription
285.681	302.66	<font color='#008080'>You&#39;ve talked about your grandmother&#39;s rhythms and you attribute your own sense of poetry to the cadence of the voice. You know, in traditional Western thought there is a split between the mind and</font>	Transcription

323.721	342.89	<font color='navy'>And that is still happening. That&#39;s why it&#39;s difficult for me to think of people composing poems on computers and typewriters. Because I just like the fact of that tactile relationship of the pen or</font>	Transcription

387.111	403.73	<font color='navy'>They talk to me. But my process is quite improvisational. So I write everything. And then I begin to edit the poem down. Initially, the poem perhaps is 150 lines long, and I edit it</font>	Transcription

406.941	425.93	<font color='navy'>And at the very end, I began to go back up through the poem from the bottom, realizing often that I&#39;ve written past the most important, most provocative, ending. The poem shouldn&#39;t resolve, shouldn&#39;t</font>	Transcription

446.391	460.46	<font color='navy'>Yes, silence. Silence. I&#39;ve said somewhere that Monk is a technician of silence. And silence is a part of music. One doesn&#39;t have music without silence. One doesn&#39;t have the</font>	Transcription
460.461	465.44	<font color='navy'>properties of modulation without silence. So that&#39;s important.</font>	Transcription
467.451	483.86	<font color='navy'>And what I feel in contemporary society-- often we don&#39;t have the capacity for solitude. So silence and solitude, all of that is part of the emotional chemistry of a piece.</font>	Transcription

491.96	506.75	<font color='navy'><b>Yusef Komunyakaa</b></font>	Speaker
491.961	506.75	<font color='navy'>I work on more than one collection at a time. Usually, usually I&#39;m working on three collections at once, side by side. And it&#39;s more or less to keep myself earnest with my emotions,</font>	Transcription

510.741	532.7	<font color='navy'>I have the ability to move from one thing to the next, and not carry over one to the other. And I don&#39;t know how that came about. I think perhaps it came about in my early writing, which was</font>	Transcription

705.681	730.73	<font color='#008080'>And it seems to me that that sense of craft, that sense of that concern for precision, has translated into not only your own sense of craft and dedication to craft, but also a work ethic. You know,</font>	Transcription

748.581	763.52	<font color='navy'>then. He was only-- it was his apprenticeship, I think. Because he built these birdhouses so concise. He built them with little porches, chimneys, and what have you. And they were built to scale.</font>	Transcription
765.321	784.61	<font color='navy'>And I suppose it has a lot to do with the fact that lumber, and nails and things were expensive, and all that stuff, you know. But he was very precise. He would measure everything two or three times,</font>	Transcription
784.611	795.44	<font color='navy'>and then we&#39;d cut a board. He said, there isn&#39;t any light between these two. That&#39;s how he would say, you know, it was a perfect fit.</font>	Transcription
797.151	812.3	<font color='navy'>But it had to do with being patient. And also, in retrospect, I realized that carpentry, especially as a finishing carpenter, there&#39;s a certain kind of solitude as well. So he probably was meditating</font>	Transcription
812.301	819.38	<font color='navy'>on a number of things as well. And writing is also an act of solitude.</font>	Transcription

933.731	946.81	<font color='navy'>And but it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;ve gone back to those pieces, and I&#39;ve seen a severe beauty in those pieces. There&#39;s a kind of beauty that isn&#39;t on the surface. There&#39;s a beauty that comes through</font>	Transcription
947.201	963.46	<font color='navy'>experience and intensity of observation. Wheras sometimes the beauty that is on the surface becomes rather problematic, because it&#39;s a beauty that knows it is supposed to be beautiful. And</font>	Transcription

1172.751	1186.85	<font color='navy'>I have to respect the music, the musicians. And the musicians I work with respect language as such. They&#39;re not in opposition to language, or there&#39;s not a contest. There&#39;s not a</font>	Transcription

1196.721	1220.09	<font color='navy'>I work very closely with Susie Ibarra, this amazing young Filipino percussionist. And she is-- she started off matter of fact, as a painter. And we have a very healthy relationship between words and</font>	Transcription

1267.441	1283.85	<font color='#008080'>Yeah, I&#39;ve talked to a number of people who collaborated, and it&#39;s interesting to hear different kinds of responses, and depending on who you talk to, you get different kinds of</font>	Transcription
1284.511	1300.35	<font color='#008080'>conceptualizations. And, but I thought you do that very, very well. Well, where do you see, you know, Black poetry going from here? Who are some of the younger poets that that you like?</font>	Transcription
1302.16	1320.1	<font color='navy'><b>Yusef Komunyakaa</b></font>	Speaker
1302.161	1320.1	<font color='navy'>There are a number of young poets out there I like. I am, especially those poets, I&#39;m more attracted to those poets who haven&#39;t embraced entertainment. I&#39;m more attracted to the</font>	Transcription
1320.101	1330.39	<font color='navy'>poets who rely heavily on the image to convey the emotion, that essentially realizing that the poem isn&#39;t an emotional act.</font>	Transcription
1333.241	1353.52	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m less attracted to the performance poets, because it seems as if they are writing basically for performance entertainment, what have you. And I mistrust entertainment because I think it helps to</font>	Transcription

1360.391	1387.6	<font color='navy'>So I-- when creativity is seen as commercial, as commodity, it becomes problematic for me. And I said somewhere that I had a problem with rap, for a simple reason. I mistrust pain as commodity.</font>	Transcription

1498.82	1516.43	<font color='navy'><b>Yusef Komunyakaa</b></font>	Speaker
1498.821	1516.43	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m surmising that a lot of poems are memorized, and particularly I&#39;m thinking of Langston Hughes, some of his poems, they memorize. And it keeps us, it keeps us conscious of</font>	Transcription
1516.431	1528.52	<font color='navy'>history, of culture, of what have you. So, there&#39;s that influence. It&#39;s an influence of necessity.</font>	Transcription
1531.101	1551.2	<font color='navy'>I was very conscious of how the poet fits into a society because I was in Chile recently, and the celebration of Neruda, and children who memorize lots of Neruda and just everyday citizens and what</font>	Transcription
1551.201	1559.78	<font color='navy'>have you. I don&#39;t know if poetry can ever function that way in this society, because there are so many distractions.</font>	Transcription
1561.311	1583.6	<font color='navy'>Again, going back to everything is entertainment. So it&#39;s to be, it&#39;s to be processed and put aside. Poetry cannot be processed and put aside that way. Poetry calls for meditation and reflection. It&#39;s</font>	Transcription
1583.601	1584.68	<font color='navy'>something that we revisit.</font>	Transcription

1586.191	1604.19	<font color='#008080'>So study is implicit in poetry. One final question. Gwendolyn Brooks said, &#39;We are each other&#39;s/ harvest:/ We are each other&#39;s/ business:/ We are each other&#39;s/ magnitude and bond.&#39; At the</font>	Transcription
1604.191	1616.52	<font color='#008080'>Furious Flower conference ten years ago, there was a sense of being bonded into a collective. In what ways is this true today, And in what ways has it changed?</font>	Transcription

1618.071	1641.68	<font color='navy'>As a collective? I do think that becomes part of-- I&#39;d rather respond to Gwendolyn Brooks&#39; work, and how I came to it is very important. I do think that need to be part of a larger</font>	Transcription
1641.921	1649.24	<font color='navy'>community perhaps is a problem.</font>	Transcription
1650.741	1668.05	<font color='navy'>I want to address that, even, in a different way. When I looked at her work, I always thought of her as an observer. Okay, and from the kitchenette, or what have you. You know, this is observation</font>	Transcription
1668.051	1677.02	<font color='navy'>tower. But I realize as well that that would have been a lonely place for her. Okay.</font>	Transcription
1678.281	1705.91	<font color='navy'>Now, this is something that isn&#39;t really talked about. She looked a certain way. Very ordinary. Okay? And we know, within the context of communities, how much emphasis is placed on looks. Okay? So I&#39;m</font>	Transcription
1705.911	1714.34	<font color='navy'>surmising that she was a very lonely individual, within the context of the larger community.</font>	Transcription
1715.151	1740.68	<font color='navy'>And in the necessity to belong, she abandoned certain moments of creative genius. Because you will see a great dichotomy between those early poems and her later poems.</font>	Transcription
1744.911	1768.61	<font color='navy'>This was this need to belong, I suppose. For the artist, I think there are moments of solitude, there are moments of loneliness, there are moments of not necessarily belonging to that larger</font>	Transcription
1768.731	1774.52	<font color='navy'>community, because that larger community often will tell you how and what to write.</font>	Transcription
1777.131	1795.91	<font color='navy'>Or what to draw, or how to see the world, which is problematic. You know? One has to see through one&#39;s own heart. One&#39;s own-- one has to be a caretaker of one&#39;s own visions, and what have you.</font>	Transcription
