8.846356	14.877963	Yusef Komunyakaa. K-o-m-u-n-y-a-k-a-a.
19.200614	21.211149	We're supposed to be looking at the camera?
21.211149	22.417471	Then, but from now on,
22.417471	23.020631	We're not here.
23.422739	24.830113	We're not here.
24.126426	28.549604	That was the only time you get to look at the camera. Now just talk to each other.
28.549604	48.453905	Well, Mr. Komunyakaa, I'm happy that you were able to come today. And I wanted to ask you about your poem, <i>Ode to a Drum</i>. I think that's one of the great classics of African American literature. How did that poem come about?
48.453905	80.019313	It's a poem of tribute to the idea of the drum. Especially since we think about the fact that drums were banned at one time in our history. What's interesting about it is this idea that-- of this object, but at the end of it, the object comes alive, and walks away.
80.019313	81.828795	Let me break you guys there.
81.828795	85.146178	Okay. And, we're rolling.
85.146178	95.500436	I wanted to ask you about your poem. <i>Ode to a Drum</i>. I think that's one of the great classics of African American literature. How did the poem come about?
95.500436	118.018434	Well the poem came out of the idea of the drum. In Congo Square, the drum had been banned for a time of slavery. And what interested me about this idea of the drum being an object,
118.018434	141.742752	It could come alive, and and be instrumental in its necessary expression, passion as such. It's also a tribute to the idea of the daughter in the in the poem as well.
141.742752	158.731777	Okay, alright. I heard you read that I think in Atlanta in the late eighties. And if I'm not mistaken, you attributed that poem in part to an experience in Australia. Am I correct about that?
158.731777	174.212901	What happened was that somebody wanted me to write a number of music related poems, to be read to music. And I meditated on the idea. And that's what I came up with.
174.212901	201.35513	There are a number of my experiences in Australia, enliven my pursuit of certain images and certain ideas and poems. A good example of that would be <i>testimony</i>. Testimony came out of someone's request to write about Charlie Parker.
201.35513	224.375761	I see, I see. Alright, well there's that ending, 'Kadoom. Kadoom', which is kind of paralinguistic imagery there. You know, it seems that sound is actually part of the meaning of the poem at that point. Would you want to comment on that?
224.375761	246.994286	Well, it also takes us back to the idea that I have that, as far as language goes, it is our first music. It has a lot to do with how something is expressed. The body knows deeply what the language is about.
246.994286	266.395953	And the body as an amplifier of emotions, images, and everything. I've seen an image somewhere that says the body remembers, and in the same way in the drum. The drum remembers life.
267.300694	285.49604	Well that's an interesting concept, because that suggests that, I mean what you're suggesting in terms of imagery coming from the body. And I've read where you've talked about poetry being integrally related to language itself.
285.49604	310.326154	You've talked about your grandmother's rhythms and you attribute your own sense of poetry to the cadence of the voice. You know, in traditional Western thought there is a split between the mind and the body-- that the two are mutually exclusive, and your comment there seems to counter that.
310.326154	323.394635	Well, essentially, one is married to the other. It's all part of the same thing. Matter of fact, the whole development of the brain, I think, has everything to do with the dexterity of the hands.
323.394635	349.632123	And that is still happening. That's why it's difficult for me to think of people composing poems on computers and typewriters. Because I just like the fact of that tactile relationship of the pen or pencil pressed against the paper, still sending signals to the brain.
349.632123	356.26689	I see. I see. Well have you read Kamau Brathwaite's recent work? Because he does a lot of experimenting--
356.166363	370.240112	Matter of fact I have, I have. And I just read a poem of his in <i>Black Renaissance</i>, which is part of that collection. But I had the privilege of reading that collection early on.
370.240112	381.700164	How do you know when a poem is finished? You have a sense of feel, or what-- how do you, how can you tell?
381.700164	384.01228	Some poems tell me that they're finished.
385.017548	386.424922	They talk to you!
387.12861	406.429751	They talk to me. But my process is quite improvisational. So I write everything. And then I begin to edit the poem down. Initially, the poem perhaps is 150 lines long, and I edit it down to 30 or 40 lines.
406.429751	428.545641	And at the very end, I began to go back up through the poem from the bottom, realizing often that I've written past the most important, most provocative, ending. The poem shouldn't resolve, shouldn't be a resolution, is what I feel.
428.545641	446.137827	I see. I see. So does this have to do with the kinds of surprises, the kinds of foregrounding of implicit knowledge that's inscribed in the music of Thelonious Monk, say?
446.137827	467.047396	Yes, silence. Silence. I've said somewhere that Monk is a technician of silence. And silence is a part of music. One doesn't have music without silence. One doesn't have the properties of modulation without silence. So that's important.
467.047396	484.036421	And what I feel in contemporary society-- often we don't have the capacity for solitude. So silence and solitude, all of that is part of the emotional chemistry of a piece.
484.036421	491.978036	Okay. Do you work on more than one poem at a time? And if you do, why is that?
491.978036	509.469695	I work on more than one collection at a time. Usually, usually I'm working on three collections at once, side by side. And it's more or less to keep myself earnest with my emotions, and passions.
509.469695	533.897701	I have the ability to move from one thing to the next, and not carry over one to the other. And I don't know how that came about. I think perhaps it came about in my early writing, which was journalistic.
535.003496	536.712451	In the military.
536.712451	565.463108	Military, yeah. Where I would cover a number of stories in a given day and not have one spill over into the other. It was defined, contained. But maybe the brain works that way anyway. I'm thinking, our capacity to handle information is definitely beyond the computer.
565.463108	567.875751	Beyond technology.
568.277858	569.685233	Beyond technology.
569.283126	570.288394	The machine.
570.288394	572.097875	The machine, yes.
572.097875	598.13431	Well, you know, you talk about-- that there's a need to remove the layers of facades and superficialities. That one's voice is already there, but you have to kind of remove the excess. Could you comment on how one does that? I'm sure it's individual but, you know--
598.13431	633.620262	One way I think is that in process, I think it's important for one to read one's work aloud to oneself. Because the ear is a great editor. I do believe that. And to be able to realize when there are false notes, and also to be able to realize that one hasn't said everything that one should say, in a given piece, to go back.
633.620262	663.878821	Revision is part of my process. But revision is to-- and for a long time I've said it was to re-see. But I've sort of expanded that to relive and re-experience as well. To be able to trust oneself with some of the early words and phrases.
663.878821	687.502613	We return to our early selves, and to trust that, to trust that space. And at the same time realizing that we're also constantly growing. So we incorporate other things into who we are, as well. Because we're active organisms.
687.502613	690.417889	A kind of a resolution of dualities.
690.417889	696.147916	Yes, yes, yes. But we're complex, and we're not one dimensional in any way.
696.147916	705.597432	Well, you know, you talked about your own background in terms of-- your father was a carpenter.
705.597432	734.951251	And it seems to me that that sense of craft, that sense of that concern for precision, has translated into not only your own sense of craft and dedication to craft, but also a work ethic. You know, you talk about writing every day. Could you comment on that?
734.951251	763.902962	Well, you know, my father was a finishing carpenter. But this last week, I was thinking about the fact that the first thing I saw him build were birdhouses. He wasn't a carpenter then. He was only-- it was his apprenticeship, I think. Because he built these birdhouses so concise. He built them with little porches, chimneys, and what have you. And they were built to scale.
763.902962	795.669423	And I suppose it has a lot to do with the fact that lumber, and nails and things were expensive, and all that stuff, you know. But he was very precise. He would measure everything two or three times, and then we'd cut a board. He said, there isn't any light between these two. That's how he would say, you know, it was a perfect fit.
795.669423	819.594795	But it had to do with being patient. And also, in retrospect, I realized that carpentry, especially as a finishing carpenter, there's a certain kind of solitude as well. So he probably was meditating on a number of things as well. And writing is also an act of solitude.
819.594795	838.292775	Yeah, certainly. The kind of patience that you mentioned, is a kind of, a certain contrast to, kind of instant commodification that we get today, in terms of--
838.292775	840.303311	Such as writing a poem on a computer.
843.721221	881.217708	Okay. Alright. You know, Brathwaite's not here. You suggested that art functions as social critique, and that beauty doesn't have to be escapist. That it can confront the evils of our time with a sort of dressed up kind of representation of life. You know, how does that-- how's that reflected in your work?
881.217708	898.91042	Well, when we think of beauty, we think of something defined for us. I would like to think of beauty in a different way, as something that we are defining as we are experiencing it.
898.91042	933.391104	Monk has a title, I think he calls it <i>Ugly Beauty</i>. And I like to think about that in a way. I have a friend who's interested in visual arts, and some of the things that she paints-- the individual who views it, initially might say, oh gosh, that is kind of almost grotesque, isn't it?
933.391104	968.474949	And but it's interesting, I've gone back to those pieces, and I've seen a severe beauty in those pieces. There's a kind of beauty that isn't on the surface. There's a beauty that comes through experience and intensity of observation. Wheras sometimes the beauty that is on the surface becomes rather problematic, because it's a beauty that knows it is supposed to be beautiful. And consequently, it is ugly inside.
968.474949	984.559233	That's a sort of a blues concept in the sense that it contains these contradictions. I'm struck by the visual appeal of your own work.
984.559233	1009.791453	I'm listening to your work. It's sort of like a series of sonic paintings where image, sound, both in terms of language and, as in certain cases, paralinguistics, tone.
1009.791453	1037.335789	Sometimes it seems as though you vary your own cadence of the poem as you're reading it aloud. And that kind of fusion of the visual and sound is very, very difficult I've found, you know, reading poets over the years. So how are you able to accomplish that?
1037.335789	1063.472751	I think it is informed by my early experiences. I grew up in a small town, Bogalusa, Louisiana. And the woods were so close to me, within a matter of minutes I could be there in the midst of all of that. And early on, I was quite taken with what I saw around me,
1063.472751	1087.096543	and realizing that there's a kind of activity underneath moments of silence, even. And so I saw things visually. I began look at and think about the rituals of animals and how those parallel human beings and what have you.
1087.096543	1121.979334	And I took my very first writing class, I think in 1973-- Dr. Alex Blackburn at the University of Colorado. And some people asked me, said Well, how do you define your poems? I said They are word paintings. That's the only, that's the only way I could define them. Because also, I had entertained the idea of painting. But I don't think I have the endurance to do it.
1121.577227	1122.884075	Let's say you paint lyrically.
1122.884075	1124.693557	Right, right, right.
1124.693557	1152.438946	Let's say that you paint that way. How does-- I mean, you've recorded with musicians, and yesterday you talked about, you know, your collaboration with an opera. How does collaborating with other artists, particularly musicians, affect your own composition of the work?
1152.438946	1156.962651	Usually work, my work is done first.
1156.962651	1159.274767	Ah, okay. So.
1159.274767	1171.941141	So, so but since I think of language as music, there is that relationship. In reading with-- I do think there has to be a mutual respect.
1171.941141	1172.845882	Sure.
1172.845882	1196.570201	I have to respect the music, the musicians. And the musicians I work with respect language as such. They're not in opposition to language, or there's not a contest. There's not a cutting contest between the reader and the musician. There's a kind of cooperation going on. So that's important.
1196.570201	1237.384071	I work very closely with Susie Ibarra, this amazing young Filipino percussionist. And she is-- she started off matter of fact, as a painter. And we have a very healthy relationship between words and music. And other musicians I've worked with, such as John Tchicai, John Tchicai had worked with poets before. Before we sat next to each other, played next to each other.
1237.384071	1248.039909	Well one more question, because, you know, when you say you've already written the poem before, well, does it affect the way that you read it? When you--
1248.039909	1255.17731	Sometimes yes. Sometimes less. Sometimes I want to introduce spaces where the music can enter.
1255.17731	1258.695747	Okay, I see. Again that silence.
1258.695747	1266.637363	Right, right right. But that silence becomes filled, it becomes filled with the genius of music.
1266.637363	1300.514886	Yeah, I've talked to a number of people who collaborated, and it's interesting to hear different kinds of responses, and depending on who you talk to, you get different kinds of conceptualizations. And, but I thought you do that very, very well. Well, where do you see, you know, Black poetry going from here? Who are some of the younger poets that that you like?
1300.514886	1331.879239	There are a number of young poets out there I like. I am, especially those poets, I'm more attracted to those poets who haven't embraced entertainment. I'm more attracted to the poets who rely heavily on the image to convey the emotion, that essentially realizing that the poem isn't an emotional act.
1331.879239	1359.121995	I'm less attracted to the performance poets, because it seems as if they are writing basically for performance entertainment, what have you. And I mistrust entertainment because I think it helps to erase the culture and erase individuality.
1359.121995	1388.27476	So I-- when creativity is seen as commercial, as commodity, it becomes problematic for me. And I said somewhere that I had a problem with rap, for a simple reason. I mistrust pain as commodity.
1388.27476	1406.470106	Okay. Well, I was gonna ask you, I'll ask you a question anyway. Because when you just, when you said it was pain, that sort of does it. But how would you counter the argument that Louis Jordan was entertainment, as well.
1406.470106	1430.294952	And, and people of his time felt, in many ways-- had very similar views about his music and other people who interpreted the blues idiom in the way that he did. Very similar to comments that you made about about hip hop or rap. How would you, how would you counter that?
1430.294952	1451.707155	Well some-- Louis Jordan wasn't a poet. For the most part, he was an entertainer. He was an entertainer, but that's what I'm talking about. Essentially, he was an entertainer. There are moments of buffoonery that I mistrust in Louis Jordan. There are also moments of genius that I do connect to in Louis Jordan.
1451.707155	1456.130333	Okay. Yeah, well. All right.
1456.130333	1457.638235	Does that make sense?
1457.135601	1460.654038	Sure, sure, no. It's, it's plenty. 
1459.749297	1464.373529	Excuse me, Tony we've got about two minutes before we're supposed to run out.
1464.273002	1466.886698	Okay well, one last question.
1466.886698	1478.547804	Well, I want you to get two more. I want you to get that one in. And then one of either the historical-- one of the themed ones. Either historical or the diaspora or-- further on. You started to ask about--
1476.637795	1481.362554	Okay, let me ask the Diaspora, and then I'm gonna ask a question about Gwendolyn Brooks.
1481.362554	1481.965714	Okay.
1481.965714	1493.224713	Okay. How do you think African American poetry has influenced poets, writers, and ordinary folks in the African diaspora?
1498.351579	1529.112772	I'm surmising that a lot of poems are memorized, and particularly I'm thinking of Langston Hughes, some of his poems, they memorize. And it keeps us, it keeps us conscious of history, of culture, of what have you. So, there's that influence. It's an influence of necessity.
1529.112772	1560.376599	I was very conscious of how the poet fits into a society because I was in Chile recently, and the celebration of Neruda, and children who memorize lots of Neruda and just everyday citizens and what have you. I don't know if poetry can ever function that way in this society, because there are so many distractions.
1560.376599	1585.206712	Again, going back to everything is entertainment. So it's to be, it's to be processed and put aside. Poetry cannot be processed and put aside that way. Poetry calls for meditation and reflection. It's something that we revisit.
1585.608819	1616.973173	So study is implicit in poetry. One final question. Gwendolyn Brooks said, 'We are each other's/ harvest:/ We are each other's/ business:/ We are each other's/ magnitude and bond.' At the Furious Flower conference ten years ago, there was a sense of being bonded into a collective. In what ways is this true today, And in what ways has it changed?
1617.877914	1649.342794	As a collective? I do think that becomes part of-- I'd rather respond to Gwendolyn Brooks' work, and how I came to it is very important. I do think that need to be part of a larger community perhaps is a problem.
1649.744901	1677.289238	I want to address that, even, in a different way. When I looked at her work, I always thought of her as an observer. Okay, and from the kitchenette, or what have you. You know, this is observation tower. But I realize as well that that would have been a lonely place for her. Okay.
1677.289238	1714.685198	Now, this is something that isn't really talked about. She looked a certain way. Very ordinary. Okay? And we know, within the context of communities, how much emphasis is placed on looks. Okay? So I'm surmising that she was a very lonely individual, within the context of the larger community.
1714.685198	1740.721633	And in the necessity to belong, she abandoned certain moments of creative genius. Because you will see a great dichotomy between those early poems and her later poems.
1740.721633	1775.40337	This was this need to belong, I suppose. For the artist, I think there are moments of solitude, there are moments of loneliness, there are moments of not necessarily belonging to that larger community, because that larger community often will tell you how and what to write.
1775.40337	1797.21768	Or what to draw, or how to see the world, which is problematic. You know? One has to see through one's own heart. One's own-- one has to be a caretaker of one's own visions, and what have you.
1797.21768	1812.296696	So sort of like a du-- sort of a blend between blues, of blues, a blues vision and a Joycean sort of positionality.
1812.296696	1814.206705	I think so, I think so.
1813.603544	1817.323035	He talks about art as pairing his fingernails, etc.
1817.323035	1823.857275	That's right. That's right. And the blues is existential.
1823.857275	1824.862543	And surrealistic
1824.862543	1829.888882	And surrealistic. That's right.
1829.888882	1834.01048	Well Mr. Komunyakaa, it's been a great pleasure talking with you.
1834.01048	1835.518381	Great pleasure talking with you.
1835.015747	1835.518381	Thank you so much.
1835.518381	1836.624176	Thank you.
1837.227336	1844.465264	Thank you, that was very nice. I just need you to talk for 30 seconds. Why don't you just make conversation while [inaudible] doing some cutaway shots.
1844.465264	1847.280014	Okay, okay. Yeah.
1847.280014	1848.486335	Don't both talk at the same time.
1848.084228	1850.798451	Well, what are you working on now?
1850.798451	1868.59169	I'm working on performance pieces now. I'm working on a piece on Gilgamesh and-- that's for stage, I've been working directly with actors. I wanted to remain true to poetry without it, so yeah. 
1868.59169	1877.236993	It's sort of like you see the poetry, at least your own work, moving in the direction of theatre.
1877.236993	1879.348055	Umm--
1880.554376	1881.05701	And that--
