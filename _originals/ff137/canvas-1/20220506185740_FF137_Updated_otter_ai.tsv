16.391	28.63	<font color='#008080'>Let me ask you-- you have a great name for a poet first of all, but what was your calling in the literature? Was there a work that you read some time or another that made you know you</font>	Transcription
28.631	31.57	<font color='#008080'>wanted to have an ongoing relationship with literature?</font>	Transcription
33.1	48.19	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
33.101	48.19	<font color='navy'>I don&#39;t recall exactly a particular work. But I do remember at a very early age, just being fascinated with the way people spoke. Just fascinated with language. I grew up in the South.</font>	Transcription
48.491	61.06	<font color='navy'>I grew up in what&#39;s possibly a typical Southern family in the latter half of the 20th century, where we had extended family, if not right in the household, in the community.</font>	Transcription
61.391	73.93	<font color='navy'>I grew up around a number of people who were aunties and mothers and uncles and elders, and I was always fascinated by their conversations. The way they discussed their personal business as well as</font>	Transcription
73.931	75.19	<font color='navy'>the business of the world.</font>	Transcription
75.491	89.68	<font color='navy'>And so I think that first fascination with language and with the cadences of language, struck me and sort of got stored for a bit inside. And then when I went to school, and started reading things,</font>	Transcription
89.681	103.54	<font color='navy'>got exposed to literature through my classes, that&#39;s when I think I decided that this was something that was-- something for me, if not a calling that I would find myself involved in at some point,</font>	Transcription
103.721	108.91	<font color='navy'>but certainly something that I would stay fascinated with and connected with, for as-- you know, all my life.</font>	Transcription
109.12	120.01	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
109.121	120.01	<font color='#008080'>What about in terms of writing? When did you hear that call that told you that I&#39;m a writer, especially a poet? When did you discover that you are a poet?</font>	Transcription
122.92	132.91	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
122.921	132.91	<font color='navy'>That&#39;s hard to say, as well, but through <i>The Darkroom Collective</i>, which was a collective of writers of color that I became involved with in Cambridge. After college, after my</font>	Transcription
132.911	145.3	<font color='navy'>college years, I would say that I decided that this is serious business, and I&#39;m going to honor this voice that I had been capturing and chronicling in my journal for years, but hadn&#39;t thought of</font>	Transcription
145.301	147.46	<font color='navy'>myself as making poetry.</font>	Transcription
147.911	160.78	<font color='navy'>Interestingly enough though, one summer as a child, I spent my whole summer writing a novel. What I thought was a novel. And I think I was about 10 years old at the time. And this was-- so obviously,</font>	Transcription
160.781	166.96	<font color='navy'>I was doing this writing, but thinking of myself as a poet, thinking of myself as a writer, that didn&#39;t come until much later.</font>	Transcription
167.291	180.85	<font color='navy'>And it came when I really came into more direct contact with, with the, you know, what we called our living literary ancestors: with those writers out there who are now becoming known as our elders,</font>	Transcription
180.851	193.24	<font color='navy'>some of whom we brought into our home, to meet and to have readings, present readings to our neighborhood. So when I started to have that sort of close up engagement with some of those writers I said</font>	Transcription
193.571	201.85	<font color='navy'>&#39;Aha&#39;. You know, I have to honor this. And, and, you know, do the work to bring that out, bring out the writing.</font>	Transcription
201.0	208.53	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
201.001	208.53	<font color='#008080'>I&#39;m not sure everyone&#39;s familiar with <i>The Darkroom Collective</i>. I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit.</font>	Transcription
208.53	222.72	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
208.531	222.72	<font color='navy'>Yes. Yes, The Darkroom Collective, formed in the aftermath of James Baldwin&#39;s death. James Baldwin died, I believe in 1987. And I was living at that point in a, in a group house in a--</font>	Transcription
222.841	234.69	<font color='navy'>well group house sounds a little odd, but I was living among other writers, artists in this large house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, situated between Harvard and MIT.</font>	Transcription
235.111	249.72	<font color='navy'>And this was-- and some of the writers that I met were fellow students at Harvard and, and other universities in the Boston-Cambridge area. And we came together because we saw that there was really a</font>	Transcription
249.721	264.39	<font color='navy'>void in terms of the kind of cultural presentations of writers and artists of color in the Cambridge-Boston area. Notwithstanding the fact that you have these very prominent communi-- universities,</font>	Transcription
265.381	276.63	<font color='navy'>who have access to all sorts of resources and could bring anyone they wanted to. In fact, Ishmael Reed was at Harvard at that point, and there were other writers in the area, but we did not, were not</font>	Transcription
276.631	281.19	<font color='navy'>experiencing them in a sort of public way, the few who did come through town.</font>	Transcription
281.191	293.16	<font color='navy'>So we launched a reading series, to celebrate the work of writers of color, and to also make connections between, to introduce and start relationships between those elder writers and then the emerging</font>	Transcription
293.161	304.65	<font color='navy'>writers. Between those established writers and ourselves and our friends and all of the other people out in the community that we thought would really want to have some sort of dialogue and fellowship</font>	Transcription
304.831	315.45	<font color='navy'>with these writers. So we started it in our home, in, in new square, in Central Square, Cambridge. And that was the founding of <i>The Dark Room Collective</i> and reading series.</font>	Transcription
316.05	321.54	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
316.051	321.54	<font color='#008080'>What about the writers who were involved in <i>The Darkroom Collective</i>? Who were some of those writers?</font>	Transcription
321.78	340.71	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
321.781	340.71	<font color='navy'>Some of those writers include Thomas Sayers Ellis, John Keene, Kevin Young, Carl Phillips, Tracy Smith. So many people, I mean, we think of it as this huge extended family of writers,</font>	Transcription
340.711	352.26	<font color='navy'>but I, there were many associations, people who were actually in the collective and then people who were present and contributed to those readings. And so in a sense we consider all of those people</font>	Transcription
352.261	362.01	<font color='navy'>the collective, as well as the writers that-- and the visual artists and the musicians who were a part of the reading series that we presented over several years time.</font>	Transcription
363.451	374.85	<font color='navy'>And so some of those names that I mentioned are names that you would know because, you know, they have since become known writers, you know, in their own right, and there are others. And, you know,</font>	Transcription
375.331	385.47	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of them later and say, oh, I meant to mention, but all of them. And at some point, we were going around traveling as a group and giving readings together,</font>	Transcription
385.621	402.0	<font color='navy'>so that the collective had a name, and a sort of tradition as a group of practicing writers, as well as the reading series that brought through many other writers: Derek Walcott, Alice Walker. So many</font>	Transcription
402.001	414.06	<font color='navy'>other people that I&#39;m forgetting Quincy Troupe, I mean a long, long list, I couldn&#39;t even begin to list them here, Michael Harper, Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Erica Hunt, Harryette Mullen. So many,</font>	Transcription
414.061	419.52	<font color='navy'>many writers, and we were privileged and fortunate to be a part of that moment.</font>	Transcription

420.781	432.99	<font color='#008080'>Talk a little bit if you don&#39;t mind about how you write. And one thing that always interests me is it seems like writers often have their own kind of sacred space, which is not always</font>	Transcription
432.991	447.51	<font color='#008080'>physical but also holes in time where you go to create what you create, and where and when does that take place for you? What is the perfect writing environment for you or the best that you&#39;ve been</font>	Transcription
447.511	449.58	<font color='#008080'>able to come by so far?</font>	Transcription
450.08	460.1	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
450.081	460.1	<font color='navy'>Well it changes a lot, but when you talk about it in terms of physical space, as well as psychic space, I would say that memory is one of those psychic spaces for me, that is an</font>	Transcription
460.101	476.84	<font color='navy'>important writing place. Because so much of my work mines my memories and, and increasingly is starting to think of the whole sort of space of Southern history, Southern Black women&#39;s history, recent</font>	Transcription
476.841	480.44	<font color='navy'>as well as past history as a another sort of psychic space,</font>	Transcription
480.651	493.97	<font color='navy'>where my writing is taking place as I start to think about those forces, and those people whose lives made-- created mine. And then in terms of physical space, well, I mean I do like to, I&#39;ve found</font>	Transcription
493.971	506.69	<font color='navy'>that I sort of need to get out in the world and sort of walk around and be out among nature, you know, and, and be in those particular physical spaces. That aids the writing, as well.</font>	Transcription
506.751	517.34	<font color='navy'>I used to think that it would, it would be this one particular corner of my house where I have my writing table, but I find that I write a lot more away from that table than I do at the table. And</font>	Transcription
517.341	530.09	<font color='navy'>then I feel that the writing is, is constantly going on in some sense, as I&#39;m walking through my day&#39;s activities. I&#39;m constantly touching base with memories or ideas or, you know, fragments of</font>	Transcription
530.391	541.04	<font color='navy'>dreams, things that are prompted through, through dream. And so that the writing is a sort of constant meditation that&#39;s going on as as well as the actual physical practice of sitting down and putting</font>	Transcription
541.041	541.97	<font color='navy'>pen to the page</font>	Transcription
541.961	555.88	<font color='navy'>or going to the computer once I&#39;ve gotten the writing to a certain point and then feel like I could commit it to the screen as well as the page. So yeah, so those are some of the spaces but I would</font>	Transcription
555.881	565.45	<font color='navy'>say I think travel for me, instigates a lot of writing. And I&#39;ve actually written about that, that act of traveling and how it adds to writing.</font>	Transcription
565.751	579.82	<font color='navy'>So I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s an ideal or one specific sort of ideal place, but I do feel like psychically it&#39;s that space of, of memory and personal history and, and family and regional mythology and</font>	Transcription
579.821	589.78	<font color='navy'>then physically it&#39;s being in touch with the, with the outside world. Being able to be among crowds and watch people move.</font>	Transcription
589.781	602.17	<font color='navy'>And so I&#39;m often in cafes, or I&#39;m often out sitting in a park, on a park bench. And I think probably a lot of writers would would say that as well. So Yeah, so I think that&#39;s maybe something</font>	Transcription
602.171	604.57	<font color='navy'>fundamental to what we&#39;re doing.</font>	Transcription

608.831	624.55	<font color='#008080'>Let me ask, could you characterize a Sharan Strange poem? Especially, what interests me is the fact that you have an MFA degree and creative writing programs try to be, it seems, very</font>	Transcription
624.581	633.61	<font color='#008080'>avant garde nowadays, at the cutting edge of writing, and it seems like you&#39;re doing something a little different than the, avant garde poets.</font>	Transcription
633.61	644.08	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
633.611	644.08	<font color='navy'>I don&#39;t think, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m avant garde. I know that I&#39;m not avant garde, and I don&#39;t think of myself as being cutting edge, or I don&#39;t think-- I know that I&#39;m not trying to</font>	Transcription
644.081	651.16	<font color='navy'>address particular trends or notions of what is cutting edge in my work.</font>	Transcription
652.001	667.6	<font color='navy'>I think that&#39;s too much to think about, for me, when I&#39;m trying so much to really engage with the raw material of my writing in a, in a very open and forthright way, because, you know, in my</font>	Transcription
667.601	680.05	<font color='navy'>collection, <i>Ash</i>, it deals very much with my childhood, growing up in rural South Carolina, and it deals a lot with my, you know, family history, family memories, and many of them are painful.</font>	Transcription
680.081	693.97	<font color='navy'>People have told me, they&#39;re, they&#39;re personal, they&#39;re painful. And, you know, so I&#39;ve had to do a lot of confronting of very personal issues. And I think that I tend to do that, more so than</font>	Transcription
694.421	706.66	<font color='navy'>thinking about well, in terms of form, am I you know, am I doing something that&#39;s breaking with everything that&#39;s come before. I think I&#39;m just concerned to, to write honestly, and as truthfully as I</font>	Transcription
706.661	710.89	<font color='navy'>can, out of the experiences that I&#39;m trying to address in the work.</font>	Transcription
711.64	723.67	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
711.641	723.67	<font color='#008080'>You&#39;ve called the South, I believe, the funky South, but nevertheless, you&#39;re back in the South. Is that by design, do you see yourself as a Southern writer? Is that what you want to be?</font>	Transcription
723.671	728.8	<font color='#008080'>Or is it just a matter of coincidence that you&#39;re back in the South practicing your craft?</font>	Transcription
729.14	740.42	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
729.141	740.42	<font color='navy'>Well, it is a little more than coincidence, but I certainly did not come back to the south, to be in the South again to write because I feel like I carry the South with me wherever I</font>	Transcription
740.421	753.05	<font color='navy'>am. And I do identify myself as a Southern writer. But I think it is interesting to be back in the South after such a long period of time, and after having written this first collection of poems that,</font>	Transcription
753.081	758.3	<font color='navy'>that dealt with my childhood experiences, and that were painful in certain ways.</font>	Transcription
758.301	770.45	<font color='navy'>Painful because of, because of the family that I grew up-- out of, and I can&#39;t think of that family situation without connecting it to a larger, you know, Southern past.</font>	Transcription
770.691	784.67	<font color='navy'>And so I feel like through those memories that I have, I carry that sense of South. And I think that in the work that I&#39;m doing, even the more personal family poems, situated poems, I&#39;m still dealing</font>	Transcription
784.671	796.7	<font color='navy'>with that, that matrix of Southern history and culture and mythology, that, that I came out of, so that whether I&#39;m in the South, or geographically in another place, I carry the South.</font>	Transcription
796.97	808.85	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
796.971	808.85	<font color='#008080'>Will you talk about one of the poems from the collection, maybe &quot;Still Life&quot;, and tell us a little bit about it and the genesis of the poem itself?</font>	Transcription
809.0	826.31	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
809.001	826.31	<font color='navy'>Okay. Well, as I said I am very much concerned with memory. And also I think of myself as a very visually oriented person. So my poetry is very visually oriented in a sense. And so</font>	Transcription
826.311	839.54	<font color='navy'>that poem &#39;Still Life&#39;, and the still life alludes as well to the notion of still life in art, you know, the capturing of things, the fixing of a thing in a moment, and in a place.</font>	Transcription
839.841	854.36	<font color='navy'>And so the memory actually deals with my mother, and an image of my mother, as a child. And how, in that moment of seeing my mother, she became something very idealized and someone very beautiful to</font>	Transcription
854.361	869.99	<font color='navy'>me. Though, as a Black woman growing up in the South, certainly the culture of the South, the Southern society did not affirm her in that way. And also within-- even within her own family she was not</font>	Transcription
869.991	871.04	<font color='navy'>affirmed in that way.</font>	Transcription
871.041	884.42	<font color='navy'>And so the poem sort of plays with that irony-- how, as a child, I see her, you know, as one would see a still life, as one would view an object in a still life, sort of idealized and captured in a</font>	Transcription
884.421	889.1	<font color='navy'>moment. And I think that&#39;s how memory works in certain ways as well so I wanted to address that.</font>	Transcription
889.311	905.0	<font color='navy'>But it goes on to address in the poem the sort of juxtaposition of that, that memory and that image that I carry, with the reality of my mother&#39;s life and my mother&#39;s marriage, which was-- and I, as a</font>	Transcription
905.001	921.26	<font color='navy'>child, witnessing my mother and father&#39;s relationship brought many painful memories of being in a relationship with a violent alcoholic, spouse, and having been the child of such a relationship</font>	Transcription
921.261	921.89	<font color='navy'>herself.</font>	Transcription
922.191	935.84	<font color='navy'>And so I wanted to address that but I also wanted to address how, even as that was true of my mother&#39;s life, I could also think of my mother in a different sense, because, as her daughter, I had to</font>	Transcription
935.841	950.75	<font color='navy'>claim for myself a more positive, a more affirmative notion of myself in the world. In that family situation, in the South, in the world. And so the poem attempts to address some of those situations,</font>	Transcription
950.751	952.01	<font color='navy'>some of those relationships.</font>	Transcription
952.32	966.36	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
952.321	966.36	<font color='#008080'>That&#39;s great. I&#39;m curious about a poem I believe you had, as part of an exhibit for Fela. We used to, when I was coming up, know him as the Nigerian James Brown, but the Black president,</font>	Transcription

980.461	983.7	<font color='navy'>question about the funky South, too, that you asked me earlier.</font>	Transcription
983.73	984.06	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
983.731	984.06	<font color='#008080'>Oh, talk about that.</font>	Transcription
984.24	995.67	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
984.241	995.67	<font color='navy'>Yes, well I did write the poem about Fela, it was actually a commissioned piece I was asked to do, to contribute to the catalog for the exhibition Fela: Black President, which was at</font>	Transcription
995.671	1005.27	<font color='navy'>the new Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. And so what I was trying to address in that poem, it&#39;s a, really a sort of, poem-- essay-as-poem.</font>	Transcription
1005.721	1017.18	<font color='navy'>I was talking about Fela&#39;s influence on my conception of Africa. And so growing up in the South, in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, I was born in 1959.</font>	Transcription
1017.211	1030.29	<font color='navy'>So I was, you know, growing-- my very early years, and my very first memories, and especially my political memories, had to do with, you know, segregation, had to do with this notion of, you know, of</font>	Transcription
1030.651	1043.52	<font color='navy'>white supremacy and, and, and the devaluing of Black people and Black people&#39;s culture and history. And so I remember, at a very early age, some of the sort of statements that were being made. My</font>	Transcription
1043.521	1049.94	<font color='navy'>first political memory was of Strom Thurmond saying that blacks would never get to vote in South Carolina, as long as he was in office.</font>	Transcription
1050.151	1062.93	<font color='navy'>So these are things that I carried inside of me. But I also then, you know, alongside that is a very rich and vibrant culture, obviously, that you know, that all Black children growing up are, you</font>	Transcription
1062.931	1069.38	<font color='navy'>know, participating in if not even aware of, of all of its dimensions. But one dimension of it for me was James Brown.</font>	Transcription
1069.831	1082.19	<font color='navy'>You know, so James Brown-- you know, so we&#39;re growing up, you know, young, poor kids, not necessarily able to read all the poetry and things that I would come to later, but we were listening to James</font>	Transcription
1082.191	1095.78	<font color='navy'>Brown, we were hearing James Brown. And, you know, soul. Soul. Say it loud, I&#39;m Black and I&#39;m proud. And then this, you know, evolution of soul into funk that James Brown then brought into his, his</font>	Transcription
1096.051	1104.0	<font color='navy'>music as well. So of course, what was happening over in Africa with Fela, is that Fela was being exposed to James Brown as well.</font>	Transcription
1104.001	1117.29	<font color='navy'>So some point later, you know, in my evolution in my history, I bring these things together. But I call myself a product of the funky South, because that&#39;s what I came out of. James Brown, and those</font>	Transcription
1117.531	1127.43	<font color='navy'>soul singers, the r&b singers, and then later, the funk singers. Parliament-Funkadelic, all these people we&#39;re listening to and dancing to in my backyard growing up.</font>	Transcription
1127.611	1140.54	<font color='navy'>So, when I think about, you know, now the moniker is the dirty South. So I distinguish that I&#39;m of that era of the funky South, and, you know, and James Brown. And so I do talk about that, in the</font>	Transcription
1140.541	1147.71	<font color='navy'>poem, the Tribute to Fela. That that was a very much, I think, a merging of our two worlds.</font>	Transcription
1148.43	1160.58	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
1148.431	1160.58	<font color='#008080'>Hearing you differentiate between the funky South and dirty South spoke to my mind of another kind of differentiation that I&#39;m hearing that you&#39;re a part of, and that&#39;s as being a new</font>	Transcription
1160.611	1174.47	<font color='#008080'>millennial Black poet. Which, you know, once that label is put out there, it means there&#39;s some difference between those who are millennial and I understand it as defined as poets who, in their 30s,</font>	Transcription
1174.471	1182.99	<font color='#008080'>who are younger, who published books. And how do you feel about that being a new millennial, African American poet?</font>	Transcription
1184.22	1194.81	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
1184.221	1194.81	<font color='navy'>Well, I&#39;m not sure about the term. I&#39;m trying to-- I think things haven&#39;t changed a whole lot in a sense and so I feel like you know, we&#39;re in this new millennium, but when we think</font>	Transcription
1194.811	1207.74	<font color='navy'>about some of the, the political issues, the issues of economic and social justice, justice that we&#39;re addressing, you know, it doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;re, you know, we, you know, embarking on a new</font>	Transcription
1207.741	1214.28	<font color='navy'>frontier. But of course we are in the sense that the, the tradition of the art continues to evolve.</font>	Transcription
1214.521	1226.16	<font color='navy'>And so what some of the younger writers are doing is they&#39;re addressing some of those themes, but they&#39;re, they&#39;re bringing different styles and different forms to it. And so-- well, I always tell my</font>	Transcription
1226.161	1241.01	<font color='navy'>students, well, you know, this spoken word generation is your generation. I sort of fall somewhere in between, you know, sort of in that little space, you know, preceding or maybe right on the verge</font>	Transcription
1241.011	1245.39	<font color='navy'>of it. So, I kind of find myself-- I think I&#39;m straddling those different eras.</font>	Transcription
1245.391	1260.15	<font color='navy'>So I guess if it&#39;s millennial in that sense, I feel like I stand right at that threshold, but what the, what the younger writers are doing, I think, and that, again, mentioning the Dirty South, I</font>	Transcription
1260.151	1266.51	<font color='navy'>think that marks you know, the the sort of passing of-- passing into a new era.</font>	Transcription
1266.511	1281.24	<font color='navy'>And I think some of that has, for the younger writers, has to do with a new sort of-- well old, as well as new sort of more direct confrontation of some of these social and political issues. I feel</font>	Transcription
1281.241	1289.64	<font color='navy'>like the, the connection between what they&#39;re doing and the Black Arts Movement poets were doing is, is clear.</font>	Transcription
1289.941	1307.4	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s been somewhat complicated, I think, by the, the hip hop industry, and some of that cross-pollination or hybridization of the poetic forms because of rap&#39;s influence on the younger generation.</font>	Transcription
1307.641	1322.1	<font color='navy'>But to me, it seems very much similar to what-- you know, the ways that the Black Arts elders addressed the, the forms that they were working with, they wanted to break with what had come before, and</font>	Transcription
1322.101	1332.0	<font color='navy'>actually maybe confront some of the issues, the political and social issues of the day, in a much more direct way.</font>	Transcription
1332.151	1346.7	<font color='navy'>So I think that that&#39;s what we talk about maybe New Millennium writing, and we think about what the younger writers are doing. And we look at the relationship of hip hop and popular culture to what</font>	Transcription
1346.701	1353.54	<font color='navy'>they&#39;re doing. I think some of that is, is a part of that notion of New Millennium writing.</font>	Transcription
1353.661	1365.06	<font color='navy'>But I think New Millennium writing just means for us that clearly, as we are still confronting, and dealing with, you know, issues of transformation, personal transformation, collective</font>	Transcription
1365.061	1379.58	<font color='navy'>transformation, and, and, you know, liberatory impulses among Black writers and Black artists generally, then, what does it mean as far as how the, the tradition of our writing is evolving in terms of</font>	Transcription
1379.581	1380.9	<font color='navy'>addressing those issues?</font>	Transcription
1382.371	1393.83	<font color='navy'>So, I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at. I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s helpful to try to find different terms for it, because it seems to me a sort of continuing same.</font>	Transcription
1394.64	1413.6	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
1394.641	1413.6	<font color='#008080'>Well, speaking of tradition-- speaking of tradition, l&#39;d like to talk about influence, and some of your specific influences from the African American literary tradition. I think of Alice</font>	Transcription
1413.601	1422.18	<font color='#008080'>Walker, I guess because [inaudible] to Sarah Lawrence, and also some of her early poems, like in the anthology Black Sister. You have similar lines.</font>	Transcription
1422.21	1423.8	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
1422.211	1423.8	<font color='navy'>We do? Okay, okay.</font>	Transcription
1423.8	1424.22	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
1423.801	1424.22	<font color='#008080'>Yeah, you do.</font>	Transcription
1425.15	1436.1	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
1425.151	1436.1	<font color='navy'>I have to admit, I haven&#39;t read Alice Walker&#39;s poetry very much. But I do feel a cert-- definitely a kinship with her as a writer, as a Southern writer, and certainly some of the</font>	Transcription
1436.161	1442.19	<font color='navy'>things that she&#39;s addressed in her novels. Yeah, I definitely feel-- so that&#39;s interesting I&#39;ll have to go back and look at some of those.</font>	Transcription
1442.22	1446.66	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
1442.221	1446.66	<font color='#008080'>Well what about some of the poets who are influential to your writing?</font>	Transcription
1447.32	1458.81	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
1447.321	1458.81	<font color='navy'>Well, you know, Gwendolyn Brooks has certainly been an influence. Not in terms of style, but, you know, certainly in terms of the approach that she took to the writing. Because I think</font>	Transcription
1458.811	1475.31	<font color='navy'>Gwendolyn Brooks, is for me, maybe exemplifies for me most what I would like to do in the writing which is to be as open as possible in terms of how I address form,</font>	Transcription
1475.691	1491.32	<font color='navy'>but also speaking about the concerns of Black people as a whole, but also Black people as first and foremost human beings. So that we are not separated and isolated from any other writers or any</font>	Transcription
1491.321	1500.89	<font color='navy'>other, you know, literary or artistic traditions. That we are very much on a stage with with all of world culture.</font>	Transcription
1501.401	1515.17	<font color='navy'>And I really think that she did that in her work even as she talked very specifically about Black women&#39;s lives or about poor people&#39;s lives, or, you know, as she then she addressed even larger</font>	Transcription
1515.261	1529.63	<font color='navy'>political themes in her work. So I, I look to her as someone who is just a guiding-- a mentor in that way. And then some of the contemporary Southern writers like Yusef Komunyakaa. His work has been</font>	Transcription
1529.631	1530.77	<font color='navy'>very important to me,</font>	Transcription
1531.101	1549.7	<font color='navy'>and especially in terms of, you know, the sort of literary techniques and devices, I&#39;m very much in awe of, you know, his tropes and his imagery. So he&#39;s been important. And, you know, Thylias Moss</font>	Transcription
1549.701	1558.73	<font color='navy'>who&#39;s not a Southern writer, she&#39;s a Midwestern writer, but very, I feel very much the the Southern roots of her work as well.</font>	Transcription
1558.0	1559.47	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
1558.001	1559.47	<font color='#008080'>But that&#39;s South anyway.</font>	Transcription
1559.5	1573.21	<font color='navy'><b>Sharan Strange</b></font>	Speaker
1559.501	1573.21	<font color='navy'>Yeah. And so Her work has been important to me. Many others, but I think when I, when I-- Toni Morrison, you know, who I think of, you know, she&#39;s a prose writer, but certainly, I see</font>	Transcription
1573.211	1577.56	<font color='navy'>her writing as poetry and uh, so she&#39;s been very influential.</font>	Transcription
1577.561	1596.1	<font color='navy'>And I continue to read, there are other writers, Neruda, whose work has spoken to me quite a great deal. There are other writers I&#39;m not-- a long list, but I think I&#39;ll just mention those, especially</font>	Transcription
1596.101	1603.36	<font color='navy'>they come to mind. So I think those are important, but there&#39;re so many others as well.</font>	Transcription
1603.89	1604.76	<font color='#008080'><b>Reggie Young</b></font>	Speaker
1603.891	1604.76	<font color='#008080'>Thank you very much.</font>	Transcription
