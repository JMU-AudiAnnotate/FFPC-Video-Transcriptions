11.291	26.53	<font color='#008080'>Sonia, Gwen said in one of her poems, &#39;This is the urgency; Live!/ and conduct your blooming in the noise of the whirlwind.&#39; I know because of our long association, that it has not</font>	Transcription
26.531	37.39	<font color='#008080'>always been easy to be a black poet in the second half of the 20th century, or the first decade of the 21st century.</font>	Transcription
37.841	44.17	<font color='#008080'>Could you talk about that a little bit? How have there been those difficulties?</font>	Transcription
44.71	54.19	<font color='navy'><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>	Speaker
44.711	54.19	<font color='navy'>Well, you know, I think that it&#39;s been difficult, you know, all the years that we&#39;ve been here in this place called America, being writers, or even poets, because you do know that</font>	Transcription
54.731	65.14	<font color='navy'>teaching in the English department, they really didn&#39;t think that we belonged there, because it is called &#39;English Department&#39;. However, we did go there, and we did make somewhat of a [inaudible]</font>	Transcription
65.321	66.1	<font color='navy'>splash.</font>	Transcription
66.271	78.45	<font color='navy'>But also what you know-- reading early literature, you understood finally, how difficult it was for DuBois, how difficult it was for Phyllis Wheatley, how difficult it was for Delaney and all those</font>	Transcription
78.451	90.99	<font color='navy'>people, Zora, to write and to be accepted as writers in this whole interesting thing called writing in America-- what they call the canon, the literary canon.</font>	Transcription
91.291	103.74	<font color='navy'>And quite often we ourselves are not even accepted into that canon, at this stage of the game, after all of these years of really what I call invigorating this thing called American writing. That&#39;s</font>	Transcription
103.741	106.17	<font color='navy'>what we&#39;ve done. We have invigorated and stretched it.</font>	Transcription
106.381	122.43	<font color='navy'>When you began to include Black writing, in, in this writing, then it opened up to Native American writers, it opened up to Jewish writers. I mean, within the genre, it opened up to Asian writing,</font>	Transcription
122.791	134.31	<font color='navy'>Women&#39;s writing, you know, Lesbian Studies, Gay Studies. And what it did is it spread all out and said, simply, you know, here we is, you know, it is not all about European writing.</font>	Transcription
134.581	148.32	<font color='navy'>And that made for such an interesting way of looking at the world, and looking at literature. I mean, you had, you have this very wonderful literature that goes on and says, you&#39;ve got to look at</font>	Transcription
148.381	158.67	<font color='navy'>something called Westward Expansion with a different eye, you know, than saying, by golly, by gee, we were just going out west to expand, no, you also killed a whole lot of people, you know, doing</font>	Transcription
158.671	159.63	<font color='navy'>that also, too.</font>	Transcription
159.751	170.52	<font color='navy'>So all that was necessary. So it meant that you had to look at the words of the Native Americans, you know, you had to understand that this was not just them, chanting, going &#39;Ooga booga booga&#39;, like</font>	Transcription
170.551	183.69	<font color='navy'>African writing, you know, or going &#39;Aayayah-wuhwuhwuh&#39; but listen, and we did that we brought that within that arena. And I remember once reading in the Midwest, and a Native American person came up</font>	Transcription
183.691	188.73	<font color='navy'>to me and said, ah, sister Sanchez, when you chanted, I heard my people.</font>	Transcription
189.031	200.67	<font color='navy'>And I remember leaning back, I leaned back on my own breath, and felt his breath and knew the connection. Which was so important to us, because at first, you were so interested in bringing just the</font>	Transcription
200.671	205.56	<font color='navy'>word of the African American writing, that you didn&#39;t always hear other people breathing around you.</font>	Transcription
205.711	216.93	<font color='navy'>But once you were able to firm yourself and look out at the world, at the diaspora, you heard other breaths, you smelled other breaths, you heard other chants, you say, this is the same chant. These</font>	Transcription
216.961	221.22	<font color='navy'>are the same words. And these are the same kind of things that are happening.</font>	Transcription
221.401	232.86	<font color='navy'>When I went to China in &#39;73 we were in Hong Kong waiting for a train. And this Chinese man came darting across the-- we were the first group, after Nixon had climbed the Great Wall of China, and so we</font>	Transcription
232.861	245.97	<font color='navy'>had people like Candice Bergen and Alice Childress, and, you know, all kinds of people going there, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the people who had been white-listed, you know, in America at</font>	Transcription
245.971	248.43	<font color='navy'>McCarthy, those writers were on that trip.</font>	Transcription
248.581	261.06	<font color='navy'>And this Chinese man came running across the, the train station, crazy in ragged clothes. Everybody jumped, and I stood and said how you doing, brother? Because see, I&#39;ve seen you in Harlem, you know,</font>	Transcription
261.061	272.46	<font color='navy'>I&#39;ve seen you in Chicago. I&#39;ve seen you in Alabama. Hello, how you doing? You know. So it&#39;s the same, and you begin to understand that, then you understand your literature more, and you understand the</font>	Transcription
272.461	274.47	<font color='navy'>world&#39;s literature more, also too.</font>	Transcription
274.5	287.31	<font color='#008080'><b>Joanne V. Gabbin</b></font>	Speaker
274.501	287.31	<font color='#008080'>Writing out of this frenetic chaos that we are so used to. A young woman stood up yesterday in the conference and talked about being from Pakistan and how we have to make a</font>	Transcription
287.311	297.57	<font color='#008080'>connection with the women in Pakistan because our experiences as women in this country are similar to those that she experienced growing up there.</font>	Transcription
297.961	311.61	<font color='#008080'>And I thought about the theme of the conference, at least the sub-theme, &#39;Cross Pollination in the Diaspora&#39;, because we have to understand that our poetry has stretched far beyond our boundaries, and</font>	Transcription
312.181	323.67	<font color='#008080'>has impacted many, many people. And I know that your poetry has done that, because you are affectionately called the poet of the universe. And why do you think people call you that?</font>	Transcription
324.21	335.76	<font color='navy'><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>	Speaker
324.211	335.76	<font color='navy'>I don&#39;t know, but the point is that I think we have learned, you know, that we all have the same voice, as I said before. When I was in China in &#39;73, and I was reading my poetry at</font>	Transcription
335.761	343.95	<font color='navy'>University of Beijing, one of the professors stood up and said, &#39;Ah, professor Sanchez. We understand this really well&#39;, they said,</font>	Transcription
344.101	356.43	<font color='navy'>What you said... we&#39;ve been in Shanghai, and he said, you know, and you&#39;re talking about your black experience, he said, but you know, here in China, they had signs in Shanghai that said, &#39;no Chinese</font>	Transcription
356.431	366.54	<font color='navy'>or dogs allowed&#39;. So what you do is that you understood, it was indeed-- that oppression, against people of color was a real oppression all over the world.</font>	Transcription
366.001	376.95	<font color='navy'>And so when we began to write what we wrote, at some point initially we thought, this is just this experience, this is just my pain. And I had to tell people, by golly, by gee, this is all our pain,</font>	Transcription
376.981	390.0	<font color='navy'>you know, here, and you know, all of it. So therefore, the greatest thing I think that happened to me, and probably to you and a lot of us in this field, is that we taught, you know, and in teaching--</font>	Transcription
390.121	394.41	<font color='navy'>I always say to people, teaching makes you-- writing and teaching will keep you human.</font>	Transcription
394.981	407.55	<font color='navy'>You know, because you will be in a classroom-- I remember teaching at Temple University up at the, up the art campus, and this young white man walked in with his hair all dyed, and he very obviously</font>	Transcription
407.551	412.59	<font color='navy'>was gay. And I was in my classes, you know, in a circle, and nobody wanted to grab his hand.</font>	Transcription
412.621	423.63	<font color='navy'>So I grabbed his hand and told this young woman &#39;you grab his hand&#39;, you know, and I held on very tightly, and I said, you&#39;re in this circle, you know, everyone&#39;s in this circle. And he was such a</font>	Transcription
423.631	427.65	<font color='navy'>great writer, that by the third week, everybody wanted to hold his hand.</font>	Transcription
427.741	440.22	<font color='navy'>So it is important for us as writers, you see-- I did a long essay, &quot;The Poet as Creator of Social Values&quot;. We who create these things, we who say and set the tone for history-- when 9/11 happened,</font>	Transcription
440.281	452.22	<font color='navy'>where did they go? They didn&#39;t go to the diplomats, they went to the poets, and say help us understand this tragedy, help us to understand what has happened, help us to breathe, because we&#39;re not</font>	Transcription
452.221	454.65	<font color='navy'>breathing, now, in this particular place, help us to live.</font>	Transcription
454.801	466.05	<font color='navy'>And writers and poets have always helped people to live. And the question that must be answered here in the 21st century is that-- What does it mean to be human? If, if we don&#39;t answer that question,</font>	Transcription
466.051	475.14	<font color='navy'>we&#39;re all doomed. You know, this is like, this is not like, what does it mean to be human if you&#39;re Black, or if you&#39;re Puerto Rican, or if you&#39;re Asian, or if you&#39;re gay, or if you&#39;re Jewish, or if</font>	Transcription
475.141	476.4	<font color='navy'>you&#39;re Muslim or whatever?</font>	Transcription
476.431	485.49	<font color='navy'>No, what does it mean to be human on this earth? Because if you don&#39;t answer it, this Earth is gonna swallow us whole and say I&#39;ll wait billions of years for some more of you to come out of the sea. I</font>	Transcription
485.491	497.82	<font color='navy'>mean, this is serious business going on right now at this particular time. So I say to my students all over, we&#39;ve got to begin to answer this question in a very real concerted effort, you know, no</font>	Transcription
497.821	502.98	<font color='navy'>half-sliding here, no half-stepping here at all, these are serious times. Period.</font>	Transcription

547.711	562.59	<font color='#008080'>like you do. But I certainly do it at the end of every semester. But the whole idea is to-- how-- whole idea is to really come up with a way of making the students feel connected. And when you do</font>	Transcription
562.591	566.58	<font color='#008080'>that, in the classroom, you model what can be done in the community.</font>	Transcription

567.721	579.57	<font color='#008080'>If you do that in the community, you model what can be done in the world. And it seems to me your perspective has always been the extended community, you know.</font>	Transcription
579.6	588.99	<font color='navy'><b>Sonia Sanchez</b></font>	Speaker
579.601	588.99	<font color='navy'>Yeah, I mean, even when we first came on the scene-- and you know, one of the things that you see is happening, when people really want to, in a sense, not open their eyes and listen,</font>	Transcription
589.171	602.64	<font color='navy'>I&#39;m always so, so surprised at people who have formed an opinion of you in 1965, and they still have the opinion in 2004. It shows two things. It&#39;s shows that the person has not grown, and the person</font>	Transcription
590.221	669.026	<font color='navy'>And when we truly understand that, then we move on a different level with each other. Because then you don&#39;t say to the person, I&#39;m going to bomb-- you bomb me, then I bomb you next. When you&#39;re</font>	Transcription
599.841	620.42	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s like the great Brecht, you know, used to do like these little small pieces similar to what Baraka does, you know? And he says in it, a friend came up and said &quot;How are you doing? How are you</font>	Transcription
602.641	717.6	<font color='navy'>thinks you have not grown.</font>	Transcription
620.421	627.89	<font color='navy'>doing? How are you feeling?&quot; You know? And he says, &quot;I&#39;m doing fine, I&#39;m doing fine.&quot; He says, &quot;and you haven&#39;t changed a bit.&quot;</font>	Transcription
628.071	638.6	<font color='navy'>And he looked at him in a very strange way and said &quot;there&#39;s something wrong with that.&quot; Why? Because, if you haven&#39;t seen me in 20 years, my sis, you better believe I&#39;ve changed. The wrinkle here is</font>	Transcription
638.601	647.24	<font color='navy'>for a reason, you know, you know, the crease here for a reason. You know, the gray hair is for a reason. You know, I don&#39;t, I mean-- someone said, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you just dye that hair, Sonia. So</font>	Transcription
647.241	649.94	<font color='navy'>then-- and don&#39;t tell your age, because then people won&#39;t know,&quot;</font>	Transcription
650.001	660.23	<font color='navy'>I said, I want people to know that I have lived these years. I want people to know that this is what this is about. And this right here came from a demonstration, you know, when I turned, and I was</font>	Transcription
660.231	669.35	<font color='navy'>knocked down, you know, and I got up-- couldn&#39;t get to ice, because I wasn&#39;t in my house, putting ice on it. So therefore every time, initially, when someone looked at it and said, &quot;Oh God, Sonia,</font>	Transcription
669.351	675.62	<font color='navy'>that&#39;s terrible there.&quot; And I looked at and I said, you know, uh huh. It could be terrible, but it could be for a reason, too.</font>	Transcription
669.433	720.21	<font color='navy'>interdependent, then you go to people, then, who can say how do we reconnect because we&#39;ve gotten disconnected at some point?</font>	Transcription
675.861	686.99	<font color='navy'>And I think everything is for a reason, you see, at some particular point. And I think that is what is important. I was just in Rome, for this great Interdependence day. And you had prime ministers</font>	Transcription
687.021	699.35	<font color='navy'>and, and diplomats from all over the world. And I opened the conference with a poem that I did about Interdependence day, because the theme is that we&#39;re all interdependent as people, you know, in our</font>	Transcription
699.351	713.93	<font color='navy'>own countries, in our separate countries, and then in the world, countries are interdependent.</font>	Transcription

791.281	799.47	<font color='navy'>world. And that is through fire, through killing, through bombings, through, you know, oppression, whatever.</font>	Transcription
799.831	808.47	<font color='navy'>What we&#39;re saying at some point, what I tried to say to the young people yesterday, is that there&#39;s a new way of looking at the world. And one of the ways that we have moved with our poetry, you know,</font>	Transcription
808.531	818.01	<font color='navy'>going from one point to another point-- when I first came on the scene, as other people came on the scene, we didn&#39;t know we had been enslaved. So we went into the library and said, Wow, God, we were</font>	Transcription
818.011	825.24	<font color='navy'>enslaved, no one told us-- for insatance my momma didn&#39;t tell me I was enslaved-- when we found that out, what did we do? We were-- we attacked everybody, then--</font>	Transcription
825.361	834.39	<font color='navy'>Everybody, didn&#39;t matter who you are, were like, &#39;bu-bududu&#39;, and even our parents. So, America said, How could you attack me? I&#39;ve been good to you. Why are you calling me those names? Like, whitey,</font>	Transcription
834.391	840.18	<font color='navy'>whatever. And you know, because-- I said to someone finally, well Black [inaudible] folks have always called you names.</font>	Transcription
840.781	849.81	<font color='navy'>Only because we had no power. So the best thing to do was like-- and I said that, but that&#39;s a Black thing. I mean, that&#39;s like when I grew up, you know, in Harlem, you played the dozens, you know,</font>	Transcription
849.841	862.08	<font color='navy'>you signified on people. So I said to-- a long interview with someone that (which they never printed) in the New York Times, I said, this is about signifying, you know, so you cannot review a book of</font>	Transcription
862.081	869.85	<font color='navy'>my poetry or anybody&#39;s poetry, unless you understand the culture of the people. You assume that you raised us all just like Topsy.</font>	Transcription
870.001	879.81	<font color='navy'>We are saying, you did not raise us like Topsy, you know, we come with new information. So when I write this particular poem, you&#39;ve got to come with information. For instance, when I used to teach</font>	Transcription

985.517	987.14	<font color='navy'>look back on it now writing my memoir now, I was the only woman in there, and I was the only Black. So poetry was all for white males,</font>	Transcription
987.141	999.695	<font color='navy'>you see, not even women. Adrienne Rich says, (in one of the anthologies she says), I really got up on stage one day and announced, I am a woman poet, okay, after I read the black poets in America, who</font>	Transcription

999.759	1010.87	<font color='navy'>were saying, I am a black poet. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m talking about the kind of influence that we had on people, because we identify ourselves, you know, from jump street, you see.</font>	Transcription
1010.001	1022.03	<font color='navy'>I really discovered it when I studied with a woman by the name of Louise Bogan. You go into American literature, and there she is, fine poet and editor for The New Yorker. You know, I mean, the poetry</font>	Transcription

1031.481	1042.19	<font color='navy'>and the first night she says, Does anyone have a poem? That&#39;s like asking a bunch of alcoholics, if they got a bottle someplace. We all went in our pockets, like this, you know, I went in my pocket,</font>	Transcription
1042.191	1053.56	<font color='navy'>and I raised my hand and said find out now, but I raised my hand. She said, Come up front, tell me your name. I did. I read the poem and she... the whole class went [raises hand], responds to it.</font>	Transcription

1215.231	1224.02	<font color='navy'>right, Latina, you know), took her child into the crack house and left her. And then there was this silence, which meant like, Oh, those people do terrible things to their children.</font>	Transcription
