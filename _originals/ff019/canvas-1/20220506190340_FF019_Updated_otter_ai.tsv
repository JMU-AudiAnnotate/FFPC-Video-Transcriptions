36.511	42.54	<font color='#008080'>Okay, so this book literally came out of the fire in some ways.</font>	Transcription
42.6	55.59	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
42.601	55.59	<font color='navy'>In a sense, yes. It was the phoenix that rose from the ashes. We had a house fire, 1998.  Lightning struck our house and it-- beyond the fact that that&#39;s the kind of tragedy you work your</font>	Transcription
55.591	70.32	<font color='navy'>way out of, it also kind of split the work in certain ways. Things that-- I identified poems, as before the fire, and after the fire. And at that point I was about halfway through a book which has</font>	Transcription
70.381	75.96	<font color='navy'>taken a different path since then. And the path that it took turned out to be <i>American Smooth</i>.</font>	Transcription
77.251	89.85	<font color='navy'>I began, my husband and I began ballroom dancing because of the fire, because our neighbors said, &quot;Oh, get out of the ashes, buy a dress, go out. Let&#39;s have fun.&quot; And when we saw people dancing, we</font>	Transcription
89.851	102.33	<font color='navy'>said, oh, we always wanted to do that. And there&#39;s a feeling of-- oddly enough of incredible freedom after such a big thing happens to you, where you feel like &quot;Well, I&#39;m alive and that&#39;s all that</font>	Transcription
102.331	104.79	<font color='navy'>matters. And I can do anything I want.&quot;</font>	Transcription
104.001	121.88	<font color='navy'>You know, the little things fall away. And we thought, we&#39;re just gonna dance. So we did. The title, <i>American Smooth</i>, is a type of ballroom dancing. It&#39;s the American, more jazzy version of</font>	Transcription
122.151	124.4	<font color='navy'>foxtrots, tangos, and waltzes.</font>	Transcription
124.911	137.36	<font color='navy'>And when I first heard this term, I thought, <i>American Smooth</i>,  that&#39;s just representative of so much that is, for me quintessentially American. And when I say quintessentially American, I mean</font>	Transcription
137.361	152.81	<font color='navy'>more African American, jazzy, the way you kind of riff on things and make them your own. And that became the overlying metaphor for the entire book, the idea of taking whatever it is, being what</font>	Transcription
152.811	156.14	<font color='navy'>history hands you or a dance style, and making it your own.</font>	Transcription
158.22	170.61	<font color='#008080'><b>Camille Dungy</b></font>	Speaker
158.221	170.61	<font color='#008080'>How-- you speak several different languages, in a matter of speaking. You speak English, you speak German, and you have an ability to pick up the nuances and intonations about their</font>	Transcription
170.611	176.07	<font color='#008080'>languages. You&#39;re also a musician, right? You play the viola de gamba and the cello,</font>	Transcription
176.401	195.84	<font color='#008080'>and now you speak the language of dance, which has its own technical terms and its own ways of physical language. How has the language of dance influenced your poetry, and do you see it differently</font>	Transcription
195.841	200.4	<font color='#008080'>influencing your poetry than the music or the German have?</font>	Transcription
201.39	216.36	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
201.391	216.36	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s an interesting question because I think all of us do have different languages, as you say, that we that we move by, that we think by. And it may be too soon for me to be able to answer</font>	Transcription
216.361	230.1	<font color='navy'>that question as well as I&#39;d like to, except that I could say that what has happened because of dance, and this is-- is that there&#39;s more physicality involved in my life, even just because you move,</font>	Transcription
230.401	231.75	<font color='navy'>you have to move in your dance.</font>	Transcription
232.231	245.79	<font color='navy'>But I think it also has informed the poems: that they really want to get up off the page and just walk around, strut around. So I think there&#39;s a little-- there&#39;s an energy in them that&#39;s different</font>	Transcription
245.821	247.53	<font color='navy'>than the energy that happened before.</font>	Transcription
248.251	262.11	<font color='navy'>I&#39;ve always been, as you said, intensely musical and the poems have been intensely musical in the sense that I really do believe that if a poem doesn&#39;t sing, it has no business being a poem. It has to</font>	Transcription
262.111	276.12	<font color='navy'>have its own music, but it has to sing that music without any kind of shame. And I&#39;ve had different kinds of music, so I think of my poems, now they&#39;re actually getting up walking around, as I said.</font>	Transcription
277.89	287.82	<font color='#008080'><b>Camille Dungy</b></font>	Speaker
277.891	287.82	<font color='#008080'>You&#39;ve talked, you were talking in particular about <i>Mother Love</i> I think when you said this, but you talk about poetry being a cage whose walls you&#39;re working against with the</font>	Transcription
287.821	297.75	<font color='#008080'>sonnets in <i>Mother Love</i> and so you&#39;re feeling with these new poems that there&#39;s a difference then that is not the restriction of the cage, or is it a different type of...?</font>	Transcription
297.0	306.93	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
297.001	306.93	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s a different cage. Different cage, that&#39;s alright. I mean, musicians can tell you, they have cages all over the place-- I mean there are measures and there are bars, there are key</font>	Transcription
306.931	316.08	<font color='navy'>signatures and there are time signatures. And in dance there are, I mean you-- no matter what kind of dance you do, you have to dance to the music.</font>	Transcription
318.061	330.63	<font color='navy'>In the dance, in the poems which are particularly about dance, specifically about dance in the book, I actually do try to get the cadence of the dances so that, for instance in a poem like <i>Fox Trot</font>	Transcription
330.661	337.11	<font color='navy'>Fridays</i>, it tries to have that easygoing stroll-- almost lilting stroll of a Nat King Cole song.</font>	Transcription
337.571	351.64	<font color='navy'>Or in a poem called <i>Bolero</i>, which is a Latin dance that has a very long, it&#39;s a very slow and sensuous dance. The poem has a very long line, combined with two short lines so that you have a</font>	Transcription
351.641	359.77	<font color='navy'>little snap in it. So there are different kinds of formal cages that the poems are into that imitate the music. But it&#39;s just a different kind of cage.</font>	Transcription
359.791	374.61	<font color='navy'>I think that maybe cage is a, has a pejorative sound. I don&#39;t think of it that way. I mean, I think of that as just the-- it&#39;s the tennis net you play with, you know, and it&#39;s the thing you get around</font>	Transcription
374.611	385.65	<font color='navy'>and say, hey, look, it&#39;s the basketball hoop. It&#39;s what you want to swoosh when you get through. And I think of it more as a challenge than as something that&#39;s restrictive.</font>	Transcription

390.191	405.82	<font color='#008080'>You talk about the different ways that you use this term <i>American Smooth</i>, and what that implies in terms of being American and operating in this world. And one of the things that</font>	Transcription
406.811	412.48	<font color='#008080'>is a central part of the book are soldiers from World War One.</font>	Transcription

413.881	426.24	<font color='#008080'>Could you talk first a little bit about how you became interested in these soldiers, and in particular, in the journal that you use with the poem passages.</font>	Transcription
428.49	445.62	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
428.491	445.62	<font color='navy'>This story starts a long time ago, it-- really those poems started, oh gosh, about 15 years ago. It started with a photo that I had seen in-- and I can&#39;t even tell you where. A history of</font>	Transcription
445.621	463.8	<font color='navy'>African Americans where there was a beautiful photo of the Black regiments that played music in World War One. And they were marching up Fifth Avenue in a perfect formation in the victory march.</font>	Transcription
466.511	481.15	<font color='navy'>this. And so I began-- I was curious. How was it that there was an all-black unit?</font>	Transcription
481.511	495.13	<font color='navy'>How did they enter the war? And the more I read the more fascinated I was. The fact is is that they were not under American command, but they entered the war under French command because the Americans</font>	Transcription
495.611	510.13	<font color='navy'>had a segregated army and didn&#39;t know how to get these African American soldiers in the American army right next to the white soldiers. And when you, it&#39;s one of these absurd situations that this</font>	Transcription
510.131	511.6	<font color='navy'>country gets itself into.</font>	Transcription
512.291	523.48	<font color='navy'>And that irony, this incredible irony that they were fighting for this war that was supposed to make the world safe for democracy, coming from a country that clearly wasn&#39;t following any rules of</font>	Transcription
523.481	536.5	<font color='navy'>democracy, and coming back to a country that still was not going to live up to its promise of democracy. All of these ironies began to gnaw at me. So that&#39;s how I became interested.</font>	Transcription
537.221	552.76	<font color='navy'>The more I read, the more I was amazed that so little was known about these men. They were-- they distinguished themselves in combat, they got more crosses of honor from the French, not from this</font>	Transcription
552.761	562.33	<font color='navy'>country, that you could, you know, shake a stick at. They didn&#39;t have adequate training yet they went over there, and were the first to reach the Rhine.</font>	Transcription
562.811	579.4	<font color='navy'>And, you know, certain units like Lieutenant James Europe&#39;s band, they played jazz everywhere, and in a certain way were the goodwill ambassadors for this country in a very ironic way. So that&#39;s how</font>	Transcription
579.401	588.61	<font color='navy'>it started, and then I began thinking about well, how do you want to present-- I knew that I wanted to write about them. I said, but how do you want to present this and I thought the best way to do</font>	Transcription
588.611	592.84	<font color='navy'>this was to-- is individuals, let each man talk.</font>	Transcription
595.091	610.0	<font color='navy'>Different men from different different aspects, and the poem that you referred to, Passages, that was a wonderful situation actually because the-- I met a man who had been in one of the Black</font>	Transcription
610.361	623.89	<font color='navy'>regiments during World War One who lived in Tucson, Arizona. I was living in Arizona, in Phoenix at the time. And when he heard that I was doing this project, he said, You know, I have a diary, you</font>	Transcription
623.891	627.34	<font color='navy'>might want to talk to, might want to interview me. I said, would I ever? Let me ask--</font>	Transcription
627.761	640.33	<font color='navy'>And I went, Fred and I, my husband and I went down to Tucson and spent a wonderful afternoon with him and his wife. And, and just, and he gave me his diary. He said, &#39;Well, you know, I&#39;m not going to</font>	Transcription
640.331	654.37	<font color='navy'>use it anymore,&#39; he said, &#39;I remember it.&#39; He says, &#39;I don&#39;t need the diary&#39;. So Passages, this very long poem, which details his travel by ship across the Atlantic to enter into war, not knowing</font>	Transcription
654.371	661.27	<font color='navy'>what&#39;s going to happen, is, so much of it is-- I tried to be true to what he said, his words.</font>	Transcription
661.871	675.58	<font color='navy'>The, in a way, in a certain way the innocence, the hope that he had. And in a certain way also kind of a stoicism, like, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re going over, I&#39;m not going to be afraid I&#39;m a soldier. And I&#39;m</font>	Transcription
675.581	679.45	<font color='navy'>going to do this.&quot; That honor, with which he entered battle.</font>	Transcription

681.791	694.06	<font color='#008080'>I see in your work several different approaches to history. There&#39;s a sort of history from an official sense, this is the story we have and let me reinvestigate the story. There&#39;s the</font>	Transcription
694.061	697.27	<font color='#008080'>personal history, just as you&#39;re talking about Peyton&#39;s journals.</font>	Transcription
697.571	712.6	<font color='#008080'>And then there&#39;s the speculative history as you&#39;re talking with the James Europe poems. That these are stories we have, images you have about James Europe, Hattie McDaniel, that we-- you reimagine in</font>	Transcription
712.601	724.06	<font color='#008080'>a sense what might have been the story of that story, or the story behind the story. In many of the poems in <i>[On] The Bus With Rosa Parks</i>, you look at figures in bus boycotts we don&#39;t often</font>	Transcription
724.061	724.87	<font color='#008080'>hear about,</font>	Transcription
725.23	725.68	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
725.231	725.68	<font color='navy'>Yes.</font>	Transcription
725.68	736.09	<font color='#008080'><b>Camille Dungy</b></font>	Speaker
725.681	736.09	<font color='#008080'>as well as Rosa Parks. What do you think of that intersection between those different kinds-- an official history, a personal history and a speculative history? How do you-- do you</font>	Transcription
736.091	739.57	<font color='#008080'>consciously work with those? Or do you find yourself working with them?</font>	Transcription
740.23	753.85	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
740.231	753.85	<font color='navy'>Probably both of those things. I consciously work at them, those intersections, because I find them fascinating, where the History of the capital H intersects the small, the lowercase</font>	Transcription
753.851	760.75	<font color='navy'>history. But I also find it creeping up on me. I think we all experience history on all of those levels.</font>	Transcription
760.931	774.58	<font color='navy'>There&#39;s the talk, you know, on the street, and then there&#39;s the front each of us puts up which is another level of personal history, but still it&#39;s already a revision of history. And then there&#39;s the</font>	Transcription
774.581	791.74	<font color='navy'>official history and-- which is whatever gets written down and lasts. I think, as a Black woman I from a very early age was aware of the ironies and the discrepancies, let&#39;s say, between history as I</font>	Transcription
791.741	794.71	<font color='navy'>experienced it, and history as it was told.</font>	Transcription
796.121	807.85	<font color='navy'>So that makes-- in the, you know, the words of DuBois, you know-- and that gives you that binocular vision when you&#39;re not in the mainstream, but you know of the mainstream and can do the mainstream</font>	Transcription
807.851	824.5	<font color='navy'>if they asked you to do it. And all of those things I find just fascinating. And I also think that&#39;s the point where we can be most aware of the ways in which we negotiate life. From the most</font>	Transcription
824.561	833.2	<font color='navy'>innermost feelings to the outward presentation. So I&#39;m at that intersection, at that crossroads, and I love it.</font>	Transcription

835.451	852.37	<font color='#008080'>You said before that when you were born, coming, sort of, too young to be really actively in Vietnam or in the Vietnam protests or actively in the Black Arts Movement, but old enough to</font>	Transcription
852.401	866.41	<font color='#008080'>be impacted by it and to sort of be aware of what was going on and following it has affected who you are as a person as an as a poet. Do you think that affects some of this, of what you&#39;re talking</font>	Transcription
866.411	869.56	<font color='#008080'>about of where and how you look at history and write about it?</font>	Transcription
871.72	895.66	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
871.721	895.66	<font color='navy'>Yes, it does. Because I was 17 in 1970, I&#39;m just trying to figure out the numbers, but I was at that point, you know, the riots in Watts happened five years before that. I was aware of them</font>	Transcription
895.901	906.61	<font color='navy'>and knew about them. Obviously, I was 12 years old, I couldn&#39;t really, you know, I couldn&#39;t really actively engage in it. I listened to the adults as they talked about things.</font>	Transcription
908.231	923.56	<font color='navy'>I think, for a large part of my life when I was growing up, I felt that I was watching history occur, and wanted to get in it, but just kind of watching it. I remember on my 10th birthday... No, my</font>	Transcription
923.561	937.15	<font color='navy'>11th birthday, there was a march on Washington. And we went down to Washington and my father marched in it, you know, and I was in my cousin&#39;s house watching on TV. You know, and so there was always</font>	Transcription
937.151	940.3	<font color='navy'>those kind of frames that I was looking through.</font>	Transcription
941.441	957.91	<font color='navy'>And I think that, yes, it did have a great influence that I was too young to go out on the streets and protest. It also sets me though to questioning and I think every human being questions themselves</font>	Transcription
957.911	960.28	<font color='navy'>at some point about things like this, but.</font>	Transcription
960.731	972.94	<font color='navy'>Well, if I had been old enough, would I have gone out or not? You know I always ask, what-- would I have been the person to stay on the bus? Would I have been the person to get arrest-- you know, how</font>	Transcription
972.941	983.62	<font color='navy'>much do we imagine that we would do something and how much are we-- will we really be ready to put it on the line? And that is, of course, what&#39;s happening in the book <i>On the Bus With Rosa</font>	Transcription
983.651	996.82	<font color='navy'>Parks</i> is kind of questioning, you know, would we have been ready to do that? Would each of us have been ready to do that? But I think that being on the sidelines perforce when I was growing up</font>	Transcription
997.211	999.46	<font color='navy'>made me think about that, perhaps earlier than some.</font>	Transcription

1120.551	1132.37	<font color='navy'>the sense that you don&#39;t let them see you sweat. You know, your enemies. You don&#39;t let-- that if you explode in violence that they&#39;ve won in a way. What you do is you get better than they are and you,</font>	Transcription
1132.431	1133.66	<font color='navy'>you know, and you work at it that way.</font>	Transcription
1133.961	1150.43	<font color='navy'>Now, I think there are good things and dangers you said about either approach, but this is how I was raised. And being naturally shy, it was actually a path that I could, could work very well I think</font>	Transcription
1151.001	1152.23	<font color='navy'>and feel good in.</font>	Transcription
1154.301	1177.19	<font color='navy'>I believe that my poems work well when they have that violence, just right under the surface ready to burst. As if they&#39;re, that it&#39;s more frightening, more threatening to feel that it is right there</font>	Transcription
1177.191	1182.71	<font color='navy'>under this polite, contained exterior, okay?</font>	Transcription
1182.001	1198.41	<font color='navy'>The poem <i>Meditation at Fifty Yards, Moving Target</i> is a poem about guns. And it&#39;s a poem about firing guns and the very eerie pleasure that that can give but also the danger of that. And in that</font>	Transcription
1198.411	1211.88	<font color='navy'>poem, because it is the idea of guns and target shooting and gun control is such a, let&#39;s say very bristly topic, you know, in this country.</font>	Transcription
1212.841	1223.85	<font color='navy'>Everyone has an opinion and immediately our defenses raise up, or our protests. And I wanted to circumvent all of that and kind of sneak in and get at it. Because when I, my-- the personal story</font>	Transcription
1223.851	1236.99	<font color='navy'>behind that is that my husband and I began to take up target practice. A friend of ours had said you need to know something about guns for self defense, and at least to know about them. He was a</font>	Transcription
1236.991	1244.79	<font color='navy'>retired general in the army and so he started out from the safety point, here&#39;s what you have to do, and this is what you know [inaudible].</font>	Transcription
1246.471	1257.75	<font color='navy'>As we began shooting these guns, and I was, of the guns, &quot;Forget it, I don&#39;t want a gun. You know, this is terrible, it&#39;s a horrible thing.&quot; And then I began to shoot this gun and I realized, well,</font>	Transcription
1257.781	1269.84	<font color='navy'>you know, there&#39;s something very interesting going on here, because there&#39;s an immense pleasure, that one can get out of shooting a gun. Incredible sense of power and possibility.</font>	Transcription
1270.111	1284.33	<font color='navy'>Now, I could sit here and I could deny those thoughts and say, No, this is bad, this is wrong, or whatever. But that doesn&#39;t get rid of the sensation. And I think it&#39;s also really important to</font>	Transcription
1284.331	1294.92	<font color='navy'>acknowledge these kinds of feelings that come up in us if you&#39;re going to understand anything about it. Also, it&#39;s a wonderful thing to be able to hit any kind of target. And I&#39;m not even talking</font>	Transcription
1294.921	1297.23	<font color='navy'>about guns, I&#39;m talking about all sorts of targets that one hits.</font>	Transcription
1297.481	1308.46	<font color='navy'>So that started that poem. But I also wanted to get into that poem the sense of, well, look. Look at the beauty of this, look at the beauty of this name, Glock, or this name, Keltec. Just think about</font>	Transcription
1308.461	1320.04	<font color='navy'>that. Now, in the middle of all that beauty, this thing can kill. And it can penetrate walls. And it can, you know, you can be defending yourself and end up killing someone in the next room because</font>	Transcription
1320.041	1325.32	<font color='navy'>you shot at the burglar, realize that that kind of power unleashed the danger of it as well.</font>	Transcription
1325.681	1337.26	<font color='navy'>Not only the beauty, but the danger. Not only the danger, but the beauty. Both of those things. So that by the end of the poem, I realized I had to talk from the point of view of the bullet, which is</font>	Transcription
1337.291	1358.53	<font color='navy'>kind of a strange thing to do. But there is something unimaginable about how fast and how single-minded a bullet is, and how completely without right or wrong, the bullet. It moves. So to go into the</font>	Transcription
1358.531	1366.39	<font color='navy'>voice of the bullet was something that I really enjoyed.</font>	Transcription
1366.961	1380.91	<font color='navy'>It frightened, it scared me to death. But it also-- I also felt like, that, to get that sense of that bullet moving so fast, faster than thought in a way. But with an absolute-- it&#39;s pure body, a</font>	Transcription
1380.911	1387.99	<font color='navy'>bullet. It&#39;s got its physical sentiment, it takes the body with it, you know, as it barrels through.</font>	Transcription
1388.471	1414.81	<font color='navy'>And that kind of violence done in a restrained manner is to my mind more penetrating, and I&#39;ll use that, you know, with the pun intended, than an outburst of protest against it. Because a protest and</font>	Transcription
1415.141	1426.78	<font color='navy'>they&#39;re all good, too. But that only convinces the ones who already believe it. You know, we&#39;re preaching to the choir then. It&#39;s better to sneak in there and convince someone before they know that</font>	Transcription
1426.781	1428.1	<font color='navy'>they&#39;re being convinced.</font>	Transcription
1430.07	1440.33	<font color='#008080'><b>Camille Dungy</b></font>	Speaker
1430.071	1440.33	<font color='#008080'>That poem, like many other of your poems, is in several parts. Why do you think you find yourself working from several angles?</font>	Transcription
1441.5	1451.61	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
1441.501	1451.61	<font color='navy'>Yeah, I do find myself working from several-- I noticed that the other night when I was giving a reading that, I said, Gosh, a lot of these poems are like four parts or something like that.</font>	Transcription
1453.651	1465.74	<font color='navy'>I think it comes from again, it&#39;s that idea of being in the official history and then getting behind the history. There are many sides to truth, there are many facets to truth.</font>	Transcription
1467.541	1481.31	<font color='navy'>And I am fascinated by exploring a situation from many different angles. Sometimes as with <i>Thomas and Beulah</i>, from the angle of the male point of view of the marriage, and then the female point</font>	Transcription
1481.311	1492.2	<font color='navy'>of view of the marriage. But in the case of <i>Meditation at Fifty Yards, Moving Target</i>, it&#39;s: let&#39;s look at it from Safety First look at it from gender, you know, men versus women and who&#39;s the</font>	Transcription
1492.201	1495.35	<font color='navy'>better shot. Let&#39;s look at it from the point of view of the bullet.</font>	Transcription
1495.351	1508.97	<font color='navy'>Let&#39;s look at it from the very act of squeezing the trigger and how accurate and controlled an action that is, if you really want to hit something, compared to the idea of, &#39;Oh, man, we&#39;re just gonna</font>	Transcription
1508.971	1524.84	<font color='navy'>shoot it up&#39;, you know. So those different angles, I think, in a way, enable-- well first of all they enable me to explore the many different sides of a topic to try to give a, if not a 360 degree</font>	Transcription
1525.891	1530.48	<font color='navy'>view of it, at least a three dimensional view of it by getting different angles.</font>	Transcription
1530.871	1545.54	<font color='navy'>For the reader of the poem, or the one who listens to the poem, I hope that it also gives them a chance to take a breath, and then plunge in and look at it again. To contemplate the moment thoroughly.</font>	Transcription
1546.441	1550.97	<font color='navy'>And to do it by different angles gives one an opportunity to do that thoroughly.</font>	Transcription
1551.75	1562.1	<font color='#008080'><b>Camille Dungy</b></font>	Speaker
1551.751	1562.1	<font color='#008080'>So do you sit down and say, I&#39;m going to write a poem in four parts? Or do you write one part? And then say, this is finished and figure out a new angle of approach?</font>	Transcription
1562.91	1575.99	<font color='navy'><b>Rita Dove</b></font>	Speaker
1562.911	1575.99	<font color='navy'>It&#39;s a good question. I can say, first of all, that I never sit down and say I&#39;m gonna write a poem in four parts. On the other hand, it&#39;s rare that I will sit down and say-- and start</font>	Transcription
1575.991	1583.94	<font color='navy'>writing and then say, Oh, it isn&#39;t finished. At some point I realize it&#39;s going to be more than one part, I can&#39;t tell you how many.</font>	Transcription
1584.321	1599.35	<font color='navy'>That poem in particular, I knew that there were two parts. Which was the first part which is called &#39;Safety First&#39; and talks about how you should handle the gun. And I knew that there was going to be</font>	Transcription
1599.351	1611.86	<font color='navy'>a part about-- the third part, which is gender politics, which is-- because one of the things that I was fascinated by, I had not known about guns, was that women tend to be better shots than men</font>	Transcription
1611.861	1619.18	<font color='navy'>because our heartbeats are slower. And so we actually have less shake.</font>	Transcription
1620.231	1632.11	<font color='navy'>When you get down to a heartbeat, and that&#39;s kind of, and so-- but actually, doing that part, led to the fourth part, the part about the bullet, which was the last thing that I thought I&#39;d ever do,</font>	Transcription
1632.621	1646.15	<font color='navy'>was write from the point of view of the bullet. But it led to that. By the time I got to the point where, oh, if it depends on a heartbeat, whether someone, you know, if a shot is really accurate, how</font>	Transcription
1646.151	1660.61	<font color='navy'>close is that to pure body? How intimate is that? And then I thought, oh, gosh, I&#39;ve got to do this bullet. This is, I thought people will think I&#39;m out of my mind, you know? But, oh well.</font>	Transcription

1681.891	1693.71	<font color='#008080'>being the reserve in your work. But you say that you need to struggle against that politeness, and I would imagine your very public roles as the US Poet Laureate and now the Virginia Poet Laureate</font>	Transcription

1714.221	1733.54	<font color='navy'>When I&#39;m writing, I think the only thing that I am concerned about is being absolutely honest. I don&#39;t believe in reserve when it comes to exploring whatever the topic is, whatever that</font>	Transcription
1733.541	1744.07	<font color='navy'>moment is, as far and as crazily as it will take me. I may say to myself, oh, people are gonna think I&#39;m crazy writing about a bullet, but I&#39;m gonna write about that bullet. You know, and I think, Oh</font>	Transcription
1744.071	1745.99	<font color='navy'>well, they might think I&#39;m crazy or maybe they won&#39;t.</font>	Transcription
1747.341	1759.22	<font color='navy'>In other words, I don&#39;t have any choice in the matter, as an artist, I feel, about whether I&#39;m going to write about something or not or what-- and how deep I&#39;m going to write about, I&#39;m gonna write as</font>	Transcription
1759.251	1770.14	<font color='navy'>deep as it needs to go. The reserve comes in the way that it&#39;s expressed, or let&#39;s say the craft of it, whether it-- what works for me.</font>	Transcription
1770.811	1787.91	<font color='navy'>And I think that I do struggle-- struggle&#39;s the wrong word, but I do push against what for me is a sense of the way a poem should be for me, and what works for me. And then I push against that, that</font>	Transcription
1788.661	1792.2	<font color='navy'>more cadenced and that more polished surface.</font>	Transcription
1792.771	1816.68	<font color='navy'>And I think that I do struggle-- struggle&#39;s the wrong word, but I do push against what for me is a sense of the way a poem should be for me, and what works for me. And then I push against that, that</font>	Transcription

1822.741	1840.59	<font color='navy'>And I think that for me the struggle comes as an artist between exploring a looser line, exploring a line that tends to-- or let&#39;s say a more rambling line, something that tends to be more exuberant,</font>	Transcription
1840.951	1853.52	<font color='navy'>in that case, something like the Hattie McDaniel poem, which is not one sentence, but feels like one sentence, it just goes on and on and on and it&#39;s a kind of a rant and a wonderful sense, was a</font>	Transcription
1853.671	1857.33	<font color='navy'>joyous release from me artistically, to be able to do.</font>	Transcription
1859.701	1885.47	<font color='navy'>Because it&#39;s not like a lot of my poems. Yeah. I don&#39;t find, I don&#39;t find it problematic, this reserve, but it is the thing that I work, it&#39;s my thing to work against. You know, it&#39;s my thing to keep</font>	Transcription
1885.471	1901.52	<font color='navy'>pushing, keep pushing, keep reminding myself, Okay. Let&#39;s, you know, you try to be reserved editing yourself, let&#39;s see if you can let it go a little bit, let&#39;s be a little messier. Let&#39;s-- so, that&#39;s</font>	Transcription

1935.031	1952.28	<font color='navy'>Whoo. That is a very big question. It&#39;s so hard-- Well, you know, gosh, it&#39;s also common to think that my poetry would influence others.</font>	Transcription
1952.311	1975.17	<font color='navy'>I think that, if anything, I&#39;m part of a tradition that is still growing among African American poets, of having the freedom to write about anything we choose without it necessarily having to be about</font>	Transcription
1975.441	1978.77	<font color='navy'>being Black, whatever one imagines by that.</font>	Transcription
1979.131	1999.86	<font color='navy'>But emanating from the entire person, and having race, gender, age, all of these things emerge in the poems in the work as they are necessary. As it colors the life without trying to make a point of</font>	Transcription
1999.861	2000.01	<font color='navy'>it.</font>	Transcription
2000.911	2017.71	<font color='navy'>I hope that there&#39;s some influence among poets of my generation, I think, on younger poets, that they would not feel the burden of explanation. I call it the burden of explanation in that it&#39;s feeling</font>	Transcription
2017.711	2029.77	<font color='navy'>that as a quote unquote &#39;minority&#39;, and I hate that word, but as it&#39;s not in the mainstream, having to explain certain cultural references.</font>	Transcription
2029.001	2043.13	<font color='navy'>You know, we have Norton anthologies, where they have footnotes, and they tell you what Keats said, and all this, you know, what this word means. And no one thinks anything of looking up all the</font>	Transcription
2043.131	2055.16	<font color='navy'>footnotes to <i>The Wasteland</i>. And yet, they would expect of most contemporary African American writers, someone could expect that they would tell them what Dixie peaches in the context of the</font>	Transcription
2055.161	2064.55	<font color='navy'>poem, what I&#39;m saying is to be able to say Dixie peach in the poem, and know that the audience will look it up, will be interested enough to look it up and won&#39;t say, well what does that mean?</font>	Transcription
2064.671	2078.89	<font color='navy'>I mean, that&#39;s the burden of explanation. And I think the more diverse the writing becomes, the more it touches on all aspects of life and just-- as if it&#39;s the most natural thing in the world, the</font>	Transcription
2078.891	2087.83	<font color='navy'>more that burden will be relieved. And I do think that some of that has come out in my work for others.</font>	Transcription
