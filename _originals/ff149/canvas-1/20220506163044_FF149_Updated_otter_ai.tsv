41.361	57.86	<font color='navy'>Well, mid to late &#39;60s... I would say it was the, the communal voice the, the voice of the, what the Africans called the Djali or the Griot. We of course had that tradition in our</font>	Transcription

70.001	86.86	<font color='navy'>And so I saw that as key, because it was the call and response and you know, and I had-- people don&#39;t realize this but I had actually sung rhythm and blues or what we call doo-wop, yeah, back in the</font>	Transcription

144.591	166.16	<font color='navy'>Yeah, I was, I had-- of course, the, I guess the central figure here in this country for us was Baba Langston Hughes, you know. Who was still a dynamic poet, and who contains as Walt Whitman said, we</font>	Transcription
166.161	168.86	<font color='navy'>said, Langston contained multitudes.</font>	Transcription
168.861	184.34	<font color='navy'>And he had written &quot;Ask Your Mama,&quot; he was a publishing poet, recording poetry and jazz and so forth. So a lot of the things which he did influenced us.</font>	Transcription
184.791	204.62	<font color='navy'>And it was out of both observing Langston Hughes and reading the Negritude poets, particularly Aimé Césaire and Léon Dumas, that in writing for Liberator magazine a little later I said that I saw the</font>	Transcription

232.661	248.89	<font color='navy'>Oh, yeah, yeah. I-- one of the things that I learned from rhythm and blues too, because we were talking or someone had talked about the actual poem as being like a script. And I guess,</font>	Transcription
248.891	259.63	<font color='navy'>like, as the Reverend said, &quot;we&#39;ll take from our text&quot;, and then you go and then you come back to it. It was that kind of a thing, you know, so.</font>	Transcription
260.951	280.3	<font color='navy'>So we were we, were very much influenced by, uh, call and response by a whole community and yeah, and the role of our, again our blues singers, our doo-wop singers, you know, call and response. So we</font>	Transcription
280.301	289.42	<font color='navy'>never saw ourselves as separate from our audience. We were like a dialectical kind of expression.</font>	Transcription

291.58	311.35	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
291.581	311.35	<font color='navy'>Oh, hey. First the Umbra poets. Calvin C. Thurnton and Lorenzo Thomas and... Lorenzo Thomas, did I say David Henderson. Ishmael, Ishmael Reed, a lot of people nowadays, view Ishmael</font>	Transcription
311.351	316.6	<font color='navy'>just as this great novelist. But Ishmael was a heck of a poet, you know?</font>	Transcription
317.051	337.63	<font color='navy'>And then a little bit later of course, my Bebop brother, Larry Neal, yeah. And then of course Amiri weaving in and out of everything downtown, and then later, coming to Harlem, us relocating in</font>	Transcription
337.631	344.68	<font color='navy'>Harlem, and more or less, riffing off each other and feeding each other in the readings.</font>	Transcription
344.001	359.54	<font color='navy'>And one of the things I want to say too, is very important just for the record, that our readings in the midst of this period were sisters and brothers reading together, and not some-- a bunch of</font>	Transcription
359.541	365.54	<font color='navy'>masculinist males, I think they call, you know, threatening the community or something, you know.</font>	Transcription
365.001	382.88	<font color='navy'>And we saw very much influence with Sonia Sanchez and Nikki Giovanni and Jackie Earley, and other sisters. Johari Amini, Carolyn Rogers, and so forth.</font>	Transcription

383.25	397.83	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
383.251	397.83	<font color='navy'>One of my things in, in this whole process has been to restore to the overall community, the role of the black female liberationist poets of the Black Arts Movement who seem to be</font>	Transcription
397.831	407.16	<font color='navy'>mysteriously written out of history. Sarah Webster Fabio, yes. Dr. Carolyn Fowler Gerald. Yes, yes.</font>	Transcription
408.39	413.64	<font color='#008080'><b>John H. Bracey Jr.</b></font>	Speaker
408.391	413.64	<font color='#008080'>Let&#39;s step down a bit to the, to the, say mid &#39;80s and &#39;90s, when you took-- your poetry took a different turn.</font>	Transcription
413.79	414.33	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
413.791	414.33	<font color='navy'>Yes.</font>	Transcription
415.32	425.91	<font color='#008080'><b>John H. Bracey Jr.</b></font>	Speaker
415.321	425.91	<font color='#008080'>You moved away from the directly political kind of, [inaudible] kind of poetry and began to do what I would call a kind of more introspective poetry going back to the Nile Valley</font>	Transcription
425.911	433.8	<font color='#008080'>and dealing with the origins of African peoples in the Nile Valley, and then doing things that had a broader historical sweep. So you want to say a bit about that? How you did that, why you did that?</font>	Transcription
433.92	451.95	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
433.921	451.95	<font color='navy'>Yes. Well, I think one of the-- two of the great influences on me, and people may find-- be somewhat surprised at this, were Pablo Neruda, and <i>The Canto General</i>, and William</font>	Transcription
451.951	454.83	<font color='navy'>Butler Yeats and the Irish Movement.</font>	Transcription
455.251	473.82	<font color='navy'>And so I had to, you know, after Langston&#39;s passing and so forth, I had to, after-- and of course, the work of mother Margaret Walker &quot;For My People&quot;, and so forth. So I-- sorta using Langston and Mr.</font>	Transcription
473.821	477.03	<font color='navy'>Hughes and Margaret Walker as a base, and so forth.</font>	Transcription
477.361	493.17	<font color='navy'>Then I began to more and more expand, I of course read the Negritude poets, but then, too, the peoples of the world, in particular, like I say, Pablo Neruda and Yeats and so forth. And I saw the whole</font>	Transcription
493.171	506.85	<font color='navy'>process of-- see I had felt that African people had been denied due to, to our Holocaust, the so called Maafa,</font>	Transcription
507.451	525.15	<font color='navy'>we had been denied our ancient voices, our ancient myth, our ancient symbolism, our ancient imagery as molders and shapers of civilization. And so I came under the influence of two giants</font>	Transcription
525.781	537.84	<font color='navy'>domestically: our elder Griot and historian John Henrik Clarke, and across-- and of course the-- what we call the living Pharaoh, the master, Cheikh Anta Diop,</font>	Transcription
538.111	558.6	<font color='navy'>and also the work of the brilliant African scholars in &#39;Présence Africaine&#39;. And so, so that-- Cheikh Anta Diop was particularly concerned about African people not linking their literature to their</font>	Transcription
558.631	574.26	<font color='navy'>classical civilizations, and he felt that Kemet, or Egypt, and Kush, Nubia were to ancient Africa, as to the Greco-Roman classical civilizations were to Western Europe.</font>	Transcription
574.711	590.97	<font color='navy'>And so he felt that until the peoples of Africa linked up to the Nile Valley classical Africa, that they would not be complete. Their literature, their being would not be complete.</font>	Transcription
591.511	607.32	<font color='navy'>And so I saw that as a challenge. We were fortunate enough in Atlanta to welcome Cheikh Anta Diop at Morehouse College, where he gave his famous Morehouse lectures. And at the Martin Luther King</font>	Transcription
607.321	618.75	<font color='navy'>International Chapel, and we walk with him through the community, and took him to a beautiful bookstore, a boutique by the shrine of the Black Madonna.</font>	Transcription
619.141	628.14	<font color='navy'>And we had all of the African masks, and so he would say-- &quot;oh,&quot; he said, &quot;You have so much!&quot; You know. And so it was just a wonderful living experience.</font>	Transcription
628.591	643.56	<font color='navy'>And so I realized that for the African peoples, other than in the deep, so called &#39;tribal&#39; traditional societies, the African image, the-- particularly the intellectuals, and the scholars and people--</font>	Transcription
643.561	657.45	<font color='navy'>the African image was not sacred because most of the mass media in the modern world is controlled by non-Africans. Specifically, the people of the North, the Europeans. And so--</font>	Transcription
657.45	662.34	<font color='#008080'><b>John H. Bracey Jr.</b></font>	Speaker
657.451	662.34	<font color='#008080'>So could you just talk about those two books again, you know, <i>From the Pyramids to the Projects</i> and <i>Dawnsong!</i></font>	Transcription
662.61	678.06	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
662.611	678.06	<font color='navy'>Yeah, that was part of my project in, so to speak, answering Cheikh Anta. The, for me rather long epic poem, From the Pyramids, to the Projects, From the Projects to the Stars, I&#39;ll</font>	Transcription
678.061	689.97	<font color='navy'>have you notice I didn&#39;t leave us at the projects. And the, the whole thing of taking a stand and, as Neruda had done with <i>The Canto General</i>,</font>	Transcription
690.301	705.69	<font color='navy'>to say, at least, I&#39;ll put as much of our history as I can in the work. Now I was really influenced by the Nile Valley and Afro-centric scholars and so forth. But I said, you know, with all due</font>	Transcription
705.691	719.22	<font color='navy'>respect to the philosophers and scholars, I said the poets not only had to know that history, but as we say, they had to make it swing, to make it rhythmic and soulful, and so forth, you know?</font>	Transcription
719.641	740.73	<font color='navy'>And so, so that was, that was part of my venture into what I would say, the spiritual realm of myth, and the, the-- resurrecting hopefully, the Neteru of what the Yoruba called the Orishas. the sacred</font>	Transcription
740.761	752.91	<font color='navy'>archetypes, or Set, the great Queen Mother of ancient Africa, but not only ancient Africa, the Mediterranean world, and so forth.</font>	Transcription
753.031	771.69	<font color='navy'>So the African woman&#39;s image as sacred, you know. And so, and then trying to modernis--nize it, I wrote a poem called &#39;Aboriginal Elegy: the Once and Future Queen&#39;, where I linked it-- the ancient</font>	Transcription
771.691	783.12	<font color='navy'>Queens Amenirdis and Gladys Knight, you know, and so forth like that, you know, Hatshepsut and Bessie Smith.</font>	Transcription
783.001	798.81	<font color='navy'>And so, so I was playing on-- I would say I was trying to reach out to ancient-- the African heritage with the arms of African diasporic culture, the African American culture, with particularly the</font>	Transcription
798.811	811.44	<font color='navy'>rhythms of the jazz and the, and the blues, and so forth, you know. So that was, that was key for my project of the &#39;80s and the &#39;90s.</font>	Transcription
811.741	826.59	<font color='navy'>But one of the things I want to make clear, and I learned this from Neruda, that I felt and I had seen-- and also somewhat from Langston and other people, too-- that the poet would speak in many</font>	Transcription
826.591	842.13	<font color='navy'>voices. That that was the discipline, you didn&#39;t just, you didn&#39;t just speak, you didn&#39;t just write one way. You wrote to-- and I felt also that our embracing our archetypes and our images and so</font>	Transcription
842.131	848.7	<font color='navy'>forth and conveying that sacredness to the world was universal.</font>	Transcription
849.121	861.3	<font color='navy'>We used to get jumped on-- my old friend Tom Feelings used to say that he get headaches of frustration, some time where educated black people would say, &#39;Why are you just painting them pictures of</font>	Transcription
861.301	873.45	<font color='navy'>black people? Why don&#39;t you paint all people?&#39; and so forth. He said, well, I paint the beauty and the humanity and dignity of black people and all people can respond to these universal care--</font>	Transcription
873.481	879.45	<font color='navy'>characteristics. And that&#39;s the way we saw our poetry. speci--</font>	Transcription

879.451	889.08	<font color='#008080'>Were alot of people, uh, writing like you did? How would you group yourself with other poets, you know, Black poets of this period? West Indian poets maybe or African poets?</font>	Transcription
889.08	905.67	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
889.081	905.67	<font color='navy'>Yeah, yeah. Yeah well, again, I know that Aimée Cesaire was doing advanced work. Unfortunately, Baba Léon Dumas passed from the scene. Senghor was doing some, some work as well. But,</font>	Transcription
905.701	921.99	<font color='navy'>you know, how to make this live-- our ancient traditions live, to recover. And Larry Neal-- people also forget that Larry was, was making exploration of that. Ishmael Reed was you know.</font>	Transcription
922.651	942.06	<font color='navy'>Ishmael Reed said that Akhenaten looked like Prophet Jones. Like, and so I started, in the work, answering back, riffing back to Ishmael, and also to Larry Neal, you know.</font>	Transcription
942.09	945.51	<font color='#008080'><b>John H. Bracey Jr.</b></font>	Speaker
942.091	945.51	<font color='#008080'>Are there any younger poets writing in this way, are you out there by yourself for the most part?</font>	Transcription

945.001	961.23	<font color='navy'>Yeah, there&#39;re younger poets. I can&#39;t recall, but I, when I wrote &#39;Juju&#39; for John Coltrane, a young poet, I think this brother was from California, wrote a poem very similar to Juju</font>	Transcription
961.321	962.67	<font color='navy'>answering me back.</font>	Transcription
963.001	980.97	<font color='navy'>And I just felt where I used more kind of ancient African and Islamic and Egyptian, he used a lot of Afro-Asian imagery with the yoga images and so forth. So I was just thrilled I have to, I&#39;ve just</font>	Transcription
980.971	992.73	<font color='navy'>been ripping and running with community work, you know, but I want to look him up and continue a dialogue with him. Because I felt that was a compliment, you know? Yes. Yeah.</font>	Transcription

992.971	1002.33	<font color='#008080'>And you read the other day, you read a poem called &#39;A Song for Patriots&#39; which is not an artypical form, it&#39;s not a poem that dealt in mythology. It was poem, a very political</font>	Transcription
1002.331	1014.87	<font color='#008080'>poem, a very contemporary poem. A poem that was in response to, you know, recent events in our culture and society. So how would you-- are you returning to your work of the &#39;60s in writing</font>	Transcription

1018.531	1034.97	<font color='navy'>Yeah, I think it&#39;s continuity. I really never left. But it&#39;s, I remember Pablo Neruda&#39;s celebrated poem, &#39;Tina Modotti is Dead&#39; where he answered some really right-wing Mexicans who</font>	Transcription
1034.971	1042.08	<font color='navy'>were attacking the great internationally known photographer who championed the Mexican people.</font>	Transcription
1042.471	1056.48	<font color='navy'>And so my, my thing was, I just wanted to make it clear, you know make it clear to our people because the right-wing Jingoists who are out here now who are bushwhacking everybody, they got people</font>	Transcription
1056.481	1070.85	<font color='navy'>scared to-- people of all groups almost afraid to say anything and calling them-- you&#39;re not patriotic if you criticize the war machine, or the corruption or the, uh, Robin Hood in reverse, stealing</font>	Transcription

1073.941	1085.04	<font color='navy'>So I said well, no, let&#39;s, let&#39;s, come on let&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s, how to-- what, what is our comment on this community sisters and brothers? So I came up with, well I said let&#39;s be, let&#39;s talk</font>	Transcription
1085.041	1096.05	<font color='navy'>patriotism. Well what are we patriotic to? Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret Walker and beautiful soulful Black sisters, and jazz.</font>	Transcription
1096.501	1115.31	<font color='navy'>And people in the churches, shoutin&#39; on Sunday. I said, and I said grape soda, Cadillacs, and so forth. And the feathery tropical flare of the sisters at church on Sunday with their fashions and so</font>	Transcription
1115.001	1131.08	<font color='navy'>So what are we loyal to? And I finally, in ending that I said, I talked about this great people who had, you know, stood down death and all the various Holocausts, the drug plagues, and everything</font>	Transcription

1145.631	1160.93	<font color='navy'>And so because I think Secretary Powell talked about, we&#39;re so loyal to America we-- this, we say, yeah, but we have to ask you, Secretary Powell, is America loyal to us? Has America by it&#39;s history,</font>	Transcription
1161.291	1172.75	<font color='navy'>been loyal to the masses of the African American people-- the Black working peoples, and stuff, in this country through the decades and centuries?</font>	Transcription

1199.721	1215.41	<font color='navy'>I do see, with the open mic movement and the, and the young poets and stuff. One of the things that I-- and I love them, and they tell me that I had a influence on them and even the</font>	Transcription
1215.411	1222.07	<font color='navy'>way they recite-- was my brothers Abiodun, Umar, and the Last Poets.</font>	Transcription
1222.311	1237.76	<font color='navy'>And so, who&#39;ve also been called the original godfathers of rap. And so, so a lot of the MCs are sampling them, and Abiodun and Umar embrace the young poets and so forth.</font>	Transcription

1253.241	1265.78	<font color='navy'>values-- I have some problems with the commercialization and the super slam thing. I&#39;m more comfortable with, more the call and response, you know, yes.</font>	Transcription
1266.801	1284.14	<font color='navy'>But, you know, the one thing Amiri has said- Amiri Baraka, has said, and I agree with him-- that, that doesn&#39;t mean that, you know, we don&#39;t manifest form and so forth. We tried to in fact, manifest</font>	Transcription
1284.171	1301.09	<font color='navy'>new form, expand the form from Langston&#39;s period with the jazz rhythms and the blues. Stephen Henderson has written a very similar book <i>Understanding [the] New Black Poetry</i> on that. In fact, we</font>	Transcription

1326.071	1340.74	<font color='navy'>that they have to really struggle like crazy with this whole commercialization and getting paid and separating the people, the poets from the community and trying to buy out what is sacred to us in</font>	Transcription

1394.001	1406.9	<font color='navy'>That, well, what I gather, they were saying well people were telling us what to write, and so forth. And so we were, we were in a period, we said, everything needs to be judged within</font>	Transcription
1406.901	1421.15	<font color='navy'>the context. In the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, even into the early &#39;80s our people were at war, what we call the 1960s, &#39;70s it was the African American Intifada, people were in the streets, battling the forces</font>	Transcription
1421.151	1422.05	<font color='navy'>of oppression.</font>	Transcription
1422.351	1438.97	<font color='navy'>I remember the early poetry of that period we wrote, we purposefully focused on shorter forms: poetry, short drama, short stories, and so forth, because, what, we were holistic, we did not-- we</font>	Transcription
1438.971	1453.13	<font color='navy'>weren&#39;t gentlemen poets, or gentle women poets. We were organizers of our people in the streets with our people and wrote poetry whenever we had a chance.</font>	Transcription
1453.371	1466.93	<font color='navy'>I remember one of the key activist brothers in Philadelphia saying that, &#39;Say, you know what&#39;s the darndest thing with Askia is that when we were, you know, having strikes and organizing community, he</font>	Transcription
1466.931	1477.01	<font color='navy'>was out there with the rest of us. We couldn&#39;t figure out when was he writing poetry?&#39; And I would say while you slept. While you slept. You know?</font>	Transcription

1477.671	1484.75	<font color='#008080'>So that&#39;s a technical question. Are you, do you work on one poem at a time? Do you work on a lot of poems simultaneously? How do you begin and how do you end?</font>	Transcription
1484.75	1501.67	<font color='navy'><b>Askia M. Touré</b></font>	Speaker
1484.751	1501.67	<font color='navy'>Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I do research, many times I do research. Either reading specific poets in terms of-- I did a lot of research in the, the epic project, reading other people&#39;s.</font>	Transcription
1501.661	1511.2	<font color='navy'>I remember Yeats and Neruda, I read Gary Snyder and his work with the whole Buddhist thing.</font>	Transcription
1511.411	1531.42	<font color='navy'>Allen Ginsberg and &#39;Howl&#39; and so forth. Early Baraka, and so forth. And so, and of course, my friend Larry Neal, mother Margaret Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, and so it&#39;s like a process of absorbing that.</font>	Transcription
1532.321	1537.87	<font color='navy'>And we used to say, when we played Whist remember you&#39;d get a hand in Whist you called a self-player?</font>	Transcription

1538.531	1553.47	<font color='navy'>Um, see, I actually believe in what the ancient people called the muse. And when I wrote-- or when it appeared through me, &#39;From the Pyramids, to the Projects, from the Projects, to</font>	Transcription
1553.471	1557.43	<font color='navy'>the Stars&#39;, the poem, it just began to flow out of me.</font>	Transcription
1557.941	1571.89	<font color='navy'>And as it was flowing, I was just trying to keep up with it as it flowed-- because I feel that we write not only with the rational, critical mind, but with the inner mind, the inner being, what the, I</font>	Transcription
1571.891	1582.75	<font color='navy'>guess the psychiatrists and people call the unconscious mind? Yes, and subconscious. And you know that that&#39;s the same thing with Trane and them, practicing their notes and stuff, but once Trane and</font>	Transcription
1582.751	1589.17	<font color='navy'>them, Pharoah and them got up on that, that bandstand, or Miles, they opened up, and then they let it flow.</font>	Transcription
1589.471	1605.01	<font color='navy'>And that&#39;s the way I tend to focus on. And then afterwards, of course, you got to rewrite and refine and polish the poem you know, and so forth. That&#39;s where your craft training comes in as well. Yes.</font>	Transcription
1606.051	1626.27	<font color='navy'>So I don&#39;t know if, you know-- I would say that I&#39;m very, I was very concerned before with the young writers, but as I interact with them, and speak with them, and listen to them struggle with each</font>	Transcription
1626.271	1630.59	<font color='navy'>other, and listen to them read, I feel better and better.</font>	Transcription
1630.831	1642.74	<font color='navy'>And then also, people will come and search you out and say &#39;brother Askia&#39; so I say yes-- &#39;I was in sister Sonia&#39;s workshop in Harlem. And I-- yeah, she told me to check this&#39;, and they said, &#39;I just</font>	Transcription
1642.741	1650.36	<font color='navy'>wanted to meet you&#39;. And so I said what are you doing? &#39;Well, I have my second book out and I&#39;m working on--&#39; I said, Alright. Alright, you know.</font>	Transcription
1650.601	1667.46	<font color='navy'>So my whole concern, I said, well in terms of our people, without being overly optimistic, we see that young people are serious about the craft, serious about the work. And I feel that our future is</font>	Transcription
